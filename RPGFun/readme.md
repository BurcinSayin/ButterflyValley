69. "Where'd that thief go now?"

70. "Trap? What trap?"

71. "So what?"

72. "Don't be silly.  If this was really the ship's "Self-Destruct Button",
      do you think they'd leave it lying around where anyone could press it?"

73. "Hmmm...the sign on the door says, "AIRLOCK".  I wonder what's inside."

74. "You're all a bunch of wimps!!  I'll prove to you myself that an entire
      orc stronghold is no match for your average barbarian."

75. "All right, we're in an unexplored dungeon in total darkness with no
      light sources or infravision...Hey, I know!!  Let's yell and scream a lot 
      so we can locate each other by sound!!"

76. "I'm going to kill our captives anyway, and I don't give a damn
      whether the other goody-good PC's like it or not."

77. "Y'know, since our druid's been so obnoxious, it would probably
      serve him right if we set his precious forest on fire."

78. "A clever bluff, Agent N42, but not clever enough.  You see, right

      cigarette lighter."

79. "A creature with two BABOON heads on a scaly REPTILIAN body?  With
      TENTACLES for arms?  Hunh.  Must be some stupid wizard's magical
      construct. Let's kill it."

80. "Yes, it's true I humiliated the DM in front of the debating team
      Wednesday, but he's much too broad-minded to take it out on my
      character."

81. "OK, O Mighty Odin, as long as you're not gonna answer my prayers,
      I'm gonna tell ya what I REALLY think of ya!"

      of contempt."

83. "Well, guys, I'm sorry my activities in the last town got us all
      tarred and feathered, but you're not going to hold that against me,
      are you?"

84. "No, I'm sure there's some stipulation that says a disintegrate spell
      won't work if the spellcaster casts it on himself.  Here, I'll
      prove it."

85. "Oops, I spilled flaming oil on my beard.  I'd better wash it off
      after we kill this fire lizard."

86. "Well, we know he's LAWFUL evil, so he should keep his word when he
      promised not to betray us."

87. "So I'm safely across the pit?  Whew!  For a minute there I was
      worried that you might remember my encumbrance penalties."

88. "Well, as long as I've stumbled into Princess Savitra's bedroom, I
      might as well try to seduce her."

89. "Thank God!!  A hobgoblin camp up ahead!  Maybe they can help heal
      our wounded!"

90. "Don't worry!  The chances of me blowing a climb walls roll twice,
      at my level, are infinitesimal."

91. "All right, I jump...Now on the way down, I activate my ring of
      feather fall...no, wait, didn't I lend it to Jim?"

92. "So you're Tiamat, huh?  Are you evil?  Yes?  Would you like
      to convert?"

93. "I cast a `gate' spell and gate in the Iraqi Air Force."

94. "Well, *I* trust our party thief, and if he says this door isn't
      trapped, that's good enough for me."

95. "Well, I didn't much like this character, anyway...Here goes
      nothing..."


96. "I swing the Toxic Avenger's mop at the grenade so I can bat it
      across the room at the aliens...Wait!  Isn't that grenade
      Contact Fused ???"

97. "All right, I guess Toronaga's right.  There can't possibly be
      anything on the other side of this airlock.  Why not open the
      damned thing."

98. "Whistling sounds?  Naw, they can't have a grenade launcher!"

99. "Okay, there's nothing guarding the bridge.  I go through the door
      and find the helm."

100. "They can't possibly outflank us.  We have a multi-scanner!"

101. "Come on!  Arrows versus Kevlar?"

102. "What do you mean Tsu Han's pilotting the shuttle?  Does he even
      have Insystem Pilot?  WHY ARE YOU SMILING AND SHAKING YOUR HEAD?"

103. "So that giant fell into the pit?  I'll jump over it and get
      his treasure."

104. "Oh, that sorceress looked a little pale when she examined the
      mirror which has the pentagram in front of it on the floor.  I
      think I'll break the mirror."

105. "It's not trapped, you just want it to yourself."{He still got it
      for himself.}
     
106. "Me first Me first."

107. "Dinosaur? Hey, no problem, right Balinor?"

108. "You call yourself a barbarian, you son of a witch ?"

109. To powerful demon:  "Try me sh*t breath!"

110. To sleeping dragon: "Oops, sorry...didn't mean to disturb you."

111. "Come on, we haven't found any so far."

112. Ranger: "What do I see?"
     DM:"Do you remember the trap that killed Indy's guide in Raiders
         of the Lost Ark?"

113. "Diamonds ... Gold... Saphires !!! Terry! Terry, we're rich, we're
      rich, we're fabulously wealthy !!!!  ...Terry .....  Terry ??"

114. "Let's walk this way."

115. "Hey folks, follow me, I remember the way to the dungeon exit."

116. "I never get to have any fun!"

117. "You mean they get to use the critical hit chart too?"

118. "Hey, I know a dragon when I see one."

119. "What do you mean the whole room we're in detects as a trap?"

120. "Hey you! Frost Giant! How's the weather up there?"

121. "Just watch, I bet I get the one item that's cursed."

122. "What does it mean when you botch an initiative roll?"

123. "Don't worry.  I know what I'm doing!"

124. "Stop!"

125. "A sign labeled `pit'?  I walk up to it."

126. "No problem.  That's easy!"

127. "Hey, I found it.  I'm keeping it."

128. "I think we'll have to reason with him."

129. "Hah! I'm not dead yet.  I still have five hit points."

130. "Oh, no.  We're being rescued.  How embarrassing!"

131. "Yeah, I know it's dangerous, but think of the experience
      points."

132. "I stand right underneath the Fire Giant and point my wand
      straight up."

133. "Don't worry.  I've got a plan."

134. "They can't see me.  I'm invisible!"

135. "I wonder what's in here?"

136. "He wouldn't try that trick again!"

137. "My two mutations? ...But I've only one!"

138. "Just because you're a dragon doesn't mean you can push ME
      around."

139. "They don't look so tough."

140. "I'm SURE there are no traps."

141. GM: "FIVE...FOUR...THREE...TWO..."
     PC: "I look for the light switch."

142. "What do you mean trolls regenerate!?!"

143. "Here kitty, kitty, kitty..."

144. "I'll open it."

145. "It seems easy enough"

146. "I think he can be trusted."

147. "Those noises are probably nothing."

148. "I'll pull the lever."

149. "Money!"

153. "Run away!"

154. "I want to kill something."

155. "All clear, guys."

156. "Gummy werebears? They should be cake to kill once they turn
      human."

157. "Wait a minute, didn't the old man say something about a curse?"

158. "Hey, where'd all the big spiders come from?"

159. "Okay, Ed, your underwear explodes!"

160. "Bob, you have any grenades left? Throw me one..."

161. "AGAIN!?!?!"

162. "He shot out my eye? Okay, I tear out my other eye and throw it
      at him as a gesture of defiance."

163. "I pull the metal ring out of the sphere."(Recognize a Holy
      Hand Grenade?)

164. "This is a push-over dungeon."

166. "I'll use my taunt skill."

167. "Your mother was a Gully Dwarf."

168. "My God will protect me."

169. "You wouldn't dare!"

170. "Hey, we're out! We're safe!"

171. "I'll try it on."

172. "C'mon!  We're a team!"

173. "You don't look like a mage!"

      infamous vampire)

186. "Mysterious shadows in the room? I'm not scared --- you can't
      spook me!"

187. "There's a smell of gas, huh? Well, my lantern is hooded. It ought
      to be safe."

188. "Take off my armor and try to swim? Forget it --- I worked hard
      to get this +3 plate mail. Besides, the DM never lets anyone
      die --- he wouldn't let me drown, would he?"

189. "I cast a lightning bolt at the ochre jelly."

190. "Lightning bolts don't ricochet off stone walls, do they?"

191. "A ballista? What's that? How many dice of damage does it do?"
     {Twenty.It's like a crossbow, only MUCH larger.}

192. "So what if he calls the guard? A backwater town like this can't
      have a very big militia."

193. "Only six inches long? Ha... Wait, you don't mean six _scale_ inches,
      do you?" {said in miniature-figures-game. Character itself
      was 3/4" high.}

219. "How would you like to have this sword?"

220. NPC:"Take this ring as a token of my esteem." {This party no longer
          accepts gifts from unknown NPC's.}

221. PLAYER:"BEGONE THINGS OF EVIL!!!"  REPLY:"Begone thing of good."

222. "I go through the door... Wait, I check for traps!"

223. "Don't be silly. That kind of monster NEVER follows you."

224. "I run up to the monster, throw my magic net over it, and try to
      take the jewel from around its neck." {But nets don't stop
      creatures from biting.}

225. "Hmmm... odd-colored walls. Well, I touch one." {turned to stone}

226. "I wonder what the black-and-yellow striped ring above the seat does?"
      { Ejection Seat. No atmosphere and no vacc-suit.}

227. "What do you mean, vacc-suit proficiency? I thought it was perfectly
      straightforward, like wearing clothes..."
      [From a character attempting to fight hand-to-hand in one.]

228. "But the directions SAID to `pull pin and throw' !"
         [From a beautifully role-played traveller character from a non-
          technological world. He was given a scout ship survival pack,
          which among other gimcracks, contained concussion grenades.
          When he got in trouble, of course, he pulled the pin out of
          one and threw it ("it" being the pin, naturally)...]

229. "Uh, what does 'explosive decompression' mean?"

230. "Why the hell do you always put `Graf' before your name? Is that
      this backward planet's equivalent of `Duke' or something?"

231. "Don't worry - I have Pilot-7."

232. "What do you mean `energy weapons are illegal' ?"

233. "DO NOT OPEN"

234. "Easy kill."

235. "I've got you now!"

236. "Is this one really able to breath fire?"

237. "Trust me. I know what I'm doing"

238. "I open the door and see who it is." {in response to a knock on
      the door}

239. "I jump off the roof - He won't get my last HP then."

240. "Oh cute!  Look at the fuzzy little cubs!"

241. "Your armor is too noisy.  Wait here and I'll scout ahead."

242. "I explain to the ogre that it was an honest mistake."

243. "Oh, he puts those in all of his dungeons.  It's a gas spore."

244. "Hubba hubba!  The nymph's taking off her clothes!"

245. "Whoever did this must be long gone by now."

246. "Easy, boy.  What's this stupid horse's problem?"

247. "You mean ...  this ... is the last ... torch?"

248. "Oh don't worry.  The poisonous ones have orange stripes."

249. "I really didn't know it was against the law."

250. "You racist!  They're elves.  So what if they're black?"

251. "This flickering torch light is playing tricks on my eyes.
      It almost seemed as though that chest moved by itself."

252. "Demogorgon."

253. "What's the duration of this Fly spell?"

254. "I don't understand.  It should be dead by now."

255. "Finally!  I thought that troll would never die."

256. "If we look brave and fearless, they won't attack."

257. "I'de feel better if we had some crampons.  Oh, what the hell,
      let's go for it."

258. "I wouldn't worry about the thieves' guild -- they don't have a
      clue who did it."

259. "Aha!  So you're the [killer/spy/vampire]!"

260. "It doesn't look very fast; we can easily swim across."

261. "While they're fighting the dragon, I sneak around behind him and
      examine his hoard."

262. "I wish we had a 10 foot pole.  Oh well."

263. "Ha ha ha!  Let's put bookworms in his spell research library."

264. "I rolled a 20.  How could that be a miss?"

265. "I've got plenty of spells; I don't need to carry a weapon."

266. "I'm heir to the crown.  They wouldn't dare!"

267. "Don't you understand?  The odds will be even.  If we can't see them,
      they can't see us."

268. "Who's bringing up the rear?"

269. "It's only one wight. The others are just ghouls."

270. "But [longbows/match locks/nuclear weapons] haven't been invented
      yet..."

271. "Look, I don't care what you think of her, or her "demonic smile."
      She's hot to trot.  So, if you'll excuse us..."

272. "I've got better things to do than run your petty errands, your
      highness."

273. "What?!  I thought you said fifTEEN kobolds."

274. "It'll be a short ocean voyage.  One week's worth of food and water
      will be enough."

275. "I won't fall in; I just want a better look at what's down there."

276. "Ochre jelly?  Ok, everyone, break out the bread and the peanut
      butter."

277. "Quit clowning around.  Look, whichever one of you is doing that,
      it's not funny."

278. "Hey!  Where's my components?"

279. "For some reason I had always imagined that bugbears were somewhat
      smaller."

280. "A trap?  That's exactly what we're supposed to expect.  I think this
      DM is more imaginative than that."

281. "After what we took, he won't be able to afford an assassin."

282. "They're usually not aggressive.  If we leave it alone, it'll leave us
      alone."

283. "Wanna see my new spell?"

284. "Something's wrong with my d20."

285. "That was no healing potion!  I'm gonna kill that swindler!"

286. "Ha!  That's the oldest trick in the book."

      this scroll."

293. "Watch this."

294. "Well, if I remember correctly, it's AC 7, 3+1 HD, 1d8 damage.  Hmm..."
     <scribble> <scribble>
     "I should defeat him around the 4th round and still have
      about 12.5 hit points left.  Ok, let's rock!"

295. "No problem!  I'll just cast a ... whoops, I forgot.  I'm just 2nd level,
      aren't I?"

296. "Did you see that guy's head?  I wonder what did this."

297. "Damned be him who first cries, 'Hold, enough!'"

298. "If you cut me down, I will only become more powerful."

299. "Zoinks!  I sure hope that's just Scooby behind me."

300. "I ain't afraid of no ghost."

301. "Geez, I'm kind of low on funds.  Ok, I'll take 500 gp for the healing
      potion."

302. "I bet it's just an illusion."

303. "Well, at least I tried...?"

304. "It's only an illusionary red dragon!"

305. "I'll attempt to patch it up." {...finding a hole in the cargo bay of the
				        orbital shuttle}

857. "You're aiming for his 'WHAT' ?"

858. "What do you mean I am holding the LAW (light anti-armor(tank) weapon)

932. GM:"You need to save VS. poison or die!"
     PC:"Whew!  I made my save!"
     GM:"OK, you only take 20hp damage!"
     PC:"Oops."

933. "Hey, look at this huge red rubin on top of the dragon's treasure. This
      one is really beautiful."

934. PC:"I wanna buy a cyberpig."
     GM: *sigh*

935. "ssssssssssss....snore....ssssssssssss...snore..."

936. "Hey, everyone knows animals don't attack druids. So let me talk to
      that giant spider."

937. "He won't hurt me, I'm wearing my magic breastplate."

938. "Okay, I jump down that cliff and use my robe of flying..."

939. "I've got the best perception in this party,and I say this bridge IS safe."

     {pool of green slime...it eats through metal very quickly}

1058. "It's an illusion.  No spell can reshape the side of a mountain like

1059. "It's just a goblin." {...or a Doppelgaenger caught by the PCs trying
			    to steal the goblns' small hoard of gold and

     ...
     "What do you mean black dragons don't breath fire?"

1119. "Damn, that's a lot of fire elementals..."

1120. "I point the wand of wonder at the big stone coffin with all of the
      wards and protection enchantments on it and say the command word.
      Hey, why are all of you guys running away?"

1121. "Just to mention it: It was your fault."

1122. "Don't worry about me - I'm fine by myself."

1132. "Beware. This is a magic seal. If you read it..."

1133. "I have the most powerful ship in the galaxy. They wouldn't dare
      attack me!"

1134. "Ha! You don't have the guts to shoot me!"

1135. "Say, didn't we have FIVE people in our party?"
     {in a dark cavern, talking to the only other character there}

1136. "What do you mean you forgot your spellbook?"

1137. PC1: "Do you remember that group of trolls whose leader you slayed?"
     PC2: "Yeah..."
     PC1: "Well, don't look now but..."

1138. "You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat!"

1139. "Orcus WHO?"

1140. "My Magic Resistance will protect me from this Earthquake." {underground}

1141. So I dropped and broke the staff of power, I have another..."

1142. "We've plenty of time until the dragon returns."

1143. "Weapons? I'm a spell-caster..."

1144. NPC: "This is the inquisition."
     PC : "What's an inquisition?"

1145. "No trap doors in this sectioooooooooooooo*bump*"

1146. "This potion really tastes good."

1147. "Is it true, that crocodiles do exist in this area?"

1148. "Well, the river isn't too deep here."

1149. "Do you think he spotted us?"

1150. "It is better to go now."

1151. "Is this potion supposed to bubble?"

1152. "Did the old man tell us that the trap is to the right or to the
      left?"

1153. "These mushrooms aren't poisoned."

1154. "Ha. Now your life is in my hands, evil witch."

1155. "Now on to the reward you promised."

1156. "If the tag says 'healing potion', then it IS healing potion!"

1157. "Excuse me, sir. You aren't allowed to carry such heavy weapons
      in this area."

1158. "Ha, you lost again. You are an awful stupid barbarian."

1159. "Well, watchword?"

1160. "Hey, yellow-skinned idiot, don't hop around but fight like a man."

1161. "Why shouldn't I turn over the next leaf?"

1162. "Watch, no trap, no seal, it's safe."

1163. {PC opens a box, finds a sphere inside, sphere starts ticking.}
     PC: "I throw away the sphere."
     ...*boom* {sphere was only the trigger, the box was the bomb}

1164. {PC just being backstabbed}
     GM: "Do you turn around?"
     PC: "No, I keep fighting."

1165. "No wonder that you're extinct." {to dinosaur creature}

1166. "What do you mean the vorpal sword didn't kill the dracolich?"

1167. "Yes!!! The wizard is dead. One more round and he would have killed
      us. What do you mean a Delayed Blast Fireball?"

1168. "I am a Ranger with a 21 Strength. I rip the tree out of the ground and
use it as a club."

1169. PC: "Wow! What a good idea to enter this cave now I'm saved."
     DM: "But it is the cave of a wyvern!"
     PC: "Oh...now I know what this pet is I just found..."

1170. "At least the fire's out."
     {said after a very disasterous crash in the group's ship.  The engine
      section of the ship blew up, starting a fire in the back. 
      Two CP's were wounded, but managed to strap in before we crashed into
      an inland sea.  When we awoke, we found that we had sank about 10 feet
      below the surface of the water, and the hull was leaking.}

1171. "Now where did I put that Thermal Detonator? What's that beeping
      noise?"

1172. GM : "Something small and roundish clinks down the stairs."
     PC1: "Grenade! I catch it."
     PC2: "I catch it."
     PC3: "I catch it."

1173. PC: "I will cast Ghoul-Touch."
     GM: "But you do not have any components."
     PC: "I know..."

1174. GM: "As you enter the cave, you notice it's pitch black and you can't
          see anything..."
     PC: "Hmmm...okay...I close my eyes!"

1175. "I avoid the gargoyle, run and drink from the healing fountain."

1176. "Ok...so Narhal's WASN'T the best spell to cast in the inn..."

1177. PC1: "Hey, I hear something very near around this corner. Christian,
           haven't you got something on the motion tracker ?"
     PC2: "Don't know, I turned off the motion tracker for saving the
           battery power for later."

1178. "I did THAT much damage?" {hit another PC by accident}

1179. "Cover me, I'll take out the mages."

1180. "Twelve knights, seven of us? You'd better get more knights..."

1181. "Oops. I think I forgot to surrender"

1182. "No brain, no pain..." {said to NPC}

1183. "Hmm... This thing looks like a radio controlled bomb. I think I
      better break off its antenna."

1184. "So what? I'm impervious to fire"
     {he was, but the hand grenades at his belt weren't}

1185. "A wall of pudding? Well, I'll eat through it...What do you mean
      the pudding bites back?!!"

1186. "I throw my nuclear hand grenade into the next room."

1187. "I hate the god of lightning and thunder."
     {Standing on a mountaintop, pointing towards heaven with a 20 yards
      long ironpole in thunder}

1188. "Don't worry, I'll have this door open in just a minute."

1189. "OK, we're in the arena.  HOW MANY lions come out of that gate?"

1190. "You can't just leave us here!" {said to party wizard just before he
				      teleported himself out of the trap}

1191. "What do you mean, we can't see where the arrows are coming from?"

1192. "What do you mean, he's still alive?"

1193. "Do you have a problem?  If not, a problem can be arranged for you."

1194. "Can we talk this over?" {no}

1195. "Hmm... No weapon, no more spells...  I hurl silver pieces at the
      wererat."

1196. "Wasn't this elevator going up?"

1197. "Finally, he's out of ammo."

1198. "What's the big deal about a guy in dragonarmor?"

1199. "That's odd.  *Most* lizardmen don't have wings."

1200. "That's odd.  The tracks end here."

1201. "A genie, huh?  Gimme my wishes!"

1202. GM: "It blinds you with a jet of acid."
     PC: "Bah! I locate it by its foul stench!"

1203. {player handles grenade, fumbles, grenade falls to the ground just
      before the PCs' feet}
     "Don't worry guys. It's harmless, it's just a neurostun-grenade."

1204. "Hey Gueso, Man you need to take a bath!...Gueso?"
     {well, it wasn't Gueso...}

1205. "Since these Ogres are under a sleep spell we don't need to kill them."

1206. "I try to jump up and pull the helmet off of the Paladin."

1207. "They've only got maces, how are they going to hurt us?"

1208. PC1: "Climb the tower. If you fall, I'll catch you !"
     PC2: "Ok."

1209. "Which side is the business side of this weapon?"

1210. "I'm going to hide behind the door in such a way that I can hit him,
      but that he cannot hit me."

1211. "Wait! I'm a good spider!" {after being polymorphed into a giant spider}

1212. GM: "You see an island on the horizon."
     PC: "I leap over the side of the ship and swim to it."
     {...in full plate mail}

1213. PC1: "Look over there is a crystal skull."
     PC2: "I run over, take my gloves off and pick the skull up."

1214. "What does 'enimity' mean?"
     {said after drawing the "Enimity between you and a devil card in a
      Deck of Many Things}

1215. "20,000 gold pieces!! I put it in my backpack and run before the
      guard wakes."  {moving is not too easy with such an encumberance}

1216. "Naw! Can't be! Assassins always wear black!"

1217. "Well, first a hills giant, then a fire giant, and after that, a clouds
      giant. There can't be Storm giant, it'll be too obvious, Ok, the exit
      is there, I feel it, let's not rest, and move on..."

1218. "You killed all my friends ! Prepare to face my ... FUMBLE!!!!"

1219. "Let's follow the trail!"

1220. "He couldn't possibly have any spell left!"

1221. "That dragon is too young to breathe fire."

1222. "Don't worry- the dragon has used all of it's breath weapons for today!"

1223. "Awe, look at the cute little fuzzy thing!"

1224. "Don't worry, we can outrun it!"

1225. "Why are those two triangles on the ground like that?" {pentagram}

1226. "Hey guys, wanna play a trick on the mage?"

1227. "What do you mean it's too late?"

1228. a)"But aren't you my friend?"
     b) "But I thought you were my friend!"

1229. "Why do you insist upon looking at my character sheet?"

1230. "I peek around the corner... but not enough to expose my whole head...
      just enough for me to see with my good eye."

1231. "I don't think he had a flame thrower. Hold on, let me check."

1232. "In the name of Tyr, I command you begone foul lich!"
     {said by overzealous first level cleric}

1233. "What do you mean my DEX bonus does not apply?"

1234. "Oh boy! Kudar is back!"
     {Kudar is the hero of the party... or was until he met the
      doppelganger!}

1235. "Don't worry, I removed all the bullets from his gun while he was
      sleeping." {he reloaded it}

1236. "But it's only a little kid!"

1237. PC1: "What do you mean my sword breaks?"
     PC2: "Don't worry, I have another one... now where did I put it?"

1238. "So that's what a Tarrasque looks like!"

1239. "I wonder who's holding that light over there."

1240. {party consists of 4 PCs}
     PC1: "Hand me the lantern"
     PC2: "I don't have it... Mark does"
     PC3: "No I don't... Joe does"
     PC4: "I'm not the one holding it"

1241. "Who knows how to stop a fireball?"

1242. "Why are you guys smiling like that?"

1243. "Hi. Mabye you can help me. I am looking for the thieve's guild..."

1244. "OK guys, here's the plan: In this movie I saw last week..."

1245. "Awe, he's drunk! He wouldn't know if I picked his pocket or his nose!"

1246. "Hey, I was talking to her first!"

1247. PC1: "Mike, are you Hindu?"
     PC2: "No, why?"
     PC3: "Because there is a red dot on your forehead!"

1248. "What do you mean my globe of invulnerability runs out?"

1249. "What do you mean my fly spell runs out?"

1250. PC1: "Shut up!  You are just a silver.  We wanted to talk to a GOLD
           dragon, at least!"
     PC2: "Umm, he doesn't look silver, guys."
     PC3: "Umm, how many metals look like silver but aren't?"
     PC2: "One.  Plat..."

1251. "Trust me, shambling mounds hate lightning."

1252. {small green leathery creature falls from the roof and wraps itself
      around PC1's face}
     PC1: "Aarrgghh!"
     PC2: "Quick...I think I've read about these...they're highly vulnerable 
           to fire!"
     PC3: {carrying torch} "OKAY!" {places flaming torch against PC1's face}
     PC1: "Aarrgghh!" {creature dies...PC1 suffering from wounds and burns
                       to the face ... PC1's hair catches fire}
     PC2: "Quick...Jump in the fountain!"
     {acid}

1253. PC1: "I fireball the Gnolls."
     Player2: "Noooooo!"
     {player2 just lost his character. His new one was to be introduced as 
      the prisoner of the Gnolls, but only the player and GM knew that. It
      was the shortest lived character I've ever seen.}

1254. PC1: "We smell gas?  Joe!  Don't cast any fire spells! Now, what did I
           just tell you?"
     PC2: "Don't cast any fire spells."
     PC1: "Good."
     {5 minutes playing later}
     PC2: "Goblins?  I cast burning hands."

1255. "We'll leave Craig at the farmhouse so he can recover."

1256. GM: "The guard's bullets are riddling the Van."
     PC: "The Briefcase!  It's full of plastic explosives!  I set the timer,
          throw it out the window and tell Dave to floor it."
     GM: "How long do you set the timer for?"
     PC: "Uhh, three seconds."

1257. "Oh no, I forgot to take my parachute..."

1258. "Well, sorry, sir. Didn't mean to hit your wife..."

1259. "Is it possible to pat these beasties?"

1260. "No need for health potions to fight a dragon!"

1261. (with an authoritative voice) : "Get out of here, hands over your head,
      you bast..."

1262. (slightly worried) : "Didn't you lock the car door a few minutes ago?"

1263. "And I say to you that you're gonna let me go out of this hospital!"

1264. "Hi, guys! I'm a bounty hunter too, just like you. And now, tell me
      who pays you to hunt these people?"

1265. "I don't care about your damned team spirit. I don't care about your
      damned discretion imperatives!"

1266. "Whaddayawant? What's wrong with my face?"

1267. "Repeating crossbows do not exist!"

1268. "Lets screw up all of her stuff!"

1269. "Last time I went left, it was a mistake... I go left again!"
      (vacuum trap)

1270. PC: "I carefully slide along the 3 inch wide ledge facing the wall."
     DM: "After about 20 feet you see a door in the wall."
     PC: "I open it."
     DM: "You open It?"
     PC: "Yeah."
     (door opened out)

1271.  GM (to player): "OK - You may now begin to laugh maniacally."

1272. "I turn myself into water and escape prison by flowing under the
      door of my cell... What do you mean casting time is five years?!"
      (fumble during spell creation)

1273. "I jump into the room and cast a fire ball at the first enemy I see."
      (He saw none, enemy hid behind the door.)

1274. GM: "You should listen to my warnings."
     PC: "Never ever!"

1275. "Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeessssss!"
      (voice from a walky-talky while party was sneaking in enemy camp)

1276. "I hear a beeping sound behind the wall? Well, I jump into the next
      room."

1277. "I am invisible and silent. I sneak up to that statue."
      (the statue with 'detect life' aura)

1278. "I pick the sleeping barbarian's pocket." (success)
     "Only thirty sea-shells?! Well, I put'em back... what do you mean
      I failed my Observation roll???"

1279. "Go ahead. You have the first strike!"

1280. (one of the PCs being possessed by a Demon)
     PC: "Maybe we should kill and later ressurect him..."

1281. "I shall subdue him with a glance from my 'Evil Eye'."

1282. "Please, I have 16 Dex, I don't need magical aids for this one."

1283. "This die is cursed.  Just throw me over that damn bridge."
      (said to a VERY dumb barbarian who didn't recognize sarcasm.)

1284. "DAMN! We got only time for one spell mage, that dragon better not win
      iniatiative!"

1285. "I don't trust you! I know you are Chaotic Evil, I am NOT going to
      leave this room as you suggest!"
      (case of false knowledge, room collapsed)

1286. PC: "Well, I may have stone hands now, but at least I survived."
     GM: "Didn't I tell you?  That fireball took damage from you too."

1287. "Of course we're alert! We're always expecting attack!"

1288. PC to another PC: "What is your problem?  Paladins are cool."
     (1st time Ravenloft player)

1289. "What?  Hill giants?  Since when do hill giants live in caves?"

1290. "We're lighthouse inspectors" (said to a cultist guard at their hq, an
      abandoned lighthouse)

1291. "Deep ones croak when they move, they can't sneak up on..." <thunk> as a
      spear pinned the pc's arm to the wall

1292. "The King in Yellow...(failed mythos role)...He'll help us!"

1293. "I shoot at the boat with my tommy gun..." from the pier, the boat was
      filled with munitions and explosives

1294. GM: "He's standing in the middle of the road, shooting at you."
     PC: "OK, I ram him with my car."
     GM (grinning): "He's climbing up the hood, tearing handholds into the
      hood with his bare hands."
     PC: "I hit the brakes and run him over..."

1295. PC: "I shoot the giant sea monster with the harpoon gun."
     GM: "The spear connects, and the rope reels out into the lake. What is
      the rope tied to?"
     PC: "The car, It won't get far."
     GM: "You're right, it's (the car) being pulled into the lake"
     PC: "But I'm between the car and the..."<roll damage>

1296. PC (to vampire): "Ya wanna go to the beach, work on the tan?"

1297. "Your passport, please?!"

1298. "Sir, you are not allowed to enter this area."

1299. "You and what army?"

1300. "If you were as smart as you think you are, you wouldn't be a cop."

1301. PC1: "Hey, a door. Why don't you knock?"
     PC2: "OK!"

1302. GM:  "Okay, as you finish off the guards you watch the (evil) priests
      finish their ceremony, and a *big* demon appears in the middle
      of their circle."
     PC1: "Okay, I fire at the nearest (evil) priest. (Firing)."
     PC2 (Priest): "Now those priests weren't the only thing to hold back
      that *big* demon - were they?"

1303. GM: "Right then, after you've killed that strange monster (mutated
      rat), you rest... After a while you hear steps round the corner
      further down the corridor... And yes it is Rob-O-COP, only
      trouble is he got his pal Ed-209 with him, what do you do?"
     PC1: "Well if we use the grenade launcher, we can afford to miss by
      a couple of meters - I say we go for it with the launcher."
     PC2: "Right I'll use this grenade (from a box of unmarked grenades).
      I have time to aim right? Allright with the aim I have a better
      chance of hitting right? (Aiming then firing)."
     GM: "Right what you see is this: the TacNuke grenade you just
      launched hits its target, and your spirits are lifted a
      microsecond until you're vaporized along with everything within
      240 meters."

1304. PC1: "Oh, you're saying that with this thought controlled plasma
     thrower all I have to do is point like this (pointing at PC2)
     and say 'Fire'." FOOOOMM.

1305. PC1: (to mission leader at HQ) "But with this map I can't lead them
      (the other players) into an ambush."
     Other Players: "TRAITOR!!!!" ZAP ZAP ZAP.

1306. PC1: (While using belt which generates a force field a round his
      body) "I fire my laser!"
     GM: "You *fire* your laser???"
     PC1: "Yes!"
     GM: "Wow you're in luck! You see your shot leaving the barrel and then
      approximately one inch from the barrel it ricochettes round until it
      hits your chest...And nothing happens.
     PC1: "I fire again!"

1307. PC2: "Right then we'd better use the DocBot" (on PC1).
     DocBot: (Ex-minesweeping bot) "Fine. I'll just check for internal
        injuries." (Opens PC1) "dum da dee...hmm LOOK OUT GRENADE!!!"
        (rips out vital organs while throwing them to a safe
        distance from the PC's).

1308. "Ohh never mind that, that's just a rabbit."

1309. "Well I know we've been there before, but what's the probability
      of them counting on us striking there again?"

1310. "Well I know we've been there twice before, but what's the
      probability of them counting on us striking there again?"

1311. PC1: "Allright I booby-trap my home in case the bad guys come to seek
      me out. And then I leave for the rendez-vouz with the other players."
     Other PC's: "We'll go to PC1's place in case he's still at home."

1312. (in Starwars) "I jump over the grenade and I use the Force."

1313. "I fall to the floor and I feign death."

1314. "The followers of Humakt can't resurrect, I know."

1315. "We try to dodge the stampede of the droids."

1316. "It's very curious. Your pet was able to find you under two or three
      meters of snow when he is in vacc-suit."
     "Yes, very curious..." BOOOOOM! (typical imperial cyborg pet with
      self-destruction device, acting as a spy)

1317. "The monster must kill my fellows to reach me. I will kill him before
      with my 9 mm gun."

1318. "No! Not another ghost!"

1319. "I don't want to hurt you."

1320. "So, how are chances for a double fumble..."

1321. "I avoid the gargoyle, run and drink from the healing fountain" (the
      water was healing, but the gargoyle not)

1322. "Please, can you repeat for me the magic words?"

1323. "It's a Nyarlathotep statue, huh? I touch his trunk."

1324. "A cthonian? Wait until I get the thompson and you'll see how long he
      lives."

1325. "I only have one hit point left. I go back, right?"

1326. "He failed with a 31? Ha, ha!. What a clumsy guy!"

1327. "Give me your beer."

1328. "I think we have finished them."

1329. "I have just deactivated the trap."

1330. "Don't worry, this gas isn't poisonous."

1331. "Cause we have finished yet, I go to take away my armour."

1332. "Well, my WISH is to become [any inanimate object]."

1333. "I bet the bridge resists."

1334. "I don't think things can become any worse."

1335. "Evidently I trust in the thief, he's one of ours, or not?"

1336. "What's the meaning of this mark in the door?"

1337. "Really, we don't need a cleric."

1338. "This dungeon is not dangerous."

1339. "Why the flame of this torch has turned to blue?"

1340. "No, I'm not reading the adventure, I'm only looking at the drawings!"

1341. "I approach to the lich and I try to put my hand in his pocket."

1342. "This door wasn't trapped the last time we came here."

1343. "Brak? What a name for a barbarian!"

1344. "I don't need to read the instructions."

1345. "This site appears to be good for encampment."

1346. "Here they won't find me."

1347. "With a 3 I pass the saving throw?"

1348. "Push first the red button and then the blue button. No, wait...!"

1349. "What is that noise like running water?"

1350. "I have never seen before a balista. How does it work?"

1351. "Hey, you who are inside! Go out and fight like men!"

1352. "I'm a cleric! I can take care of all the undead!"

1353. "We're lucky, a demon prince! If we kill him we got a lot of experience
      and treasure!"

1354. "This looks like some class of mold."

1355.  "I'm sure I saw a scorpion run into this cell, let's search for it!"

1356. "What do you mean 'Turned to stone'?"

1357. "Lions are only active at night, aren't they?"

1358. "Shhhhh!!! it's asleep!"

      PC1: "Then you mean all this gold I've been collecting was...."

1531. PC: "Give yourself up! You already used all six of your bullets, I
      counted them."
     Gunslinger: "Oh, is that so?"

      my head and ricocheted hitting the wall, and the sixth bullet hit the
      wall...wait a minute.."

1534. "What do you mean, the sword shattered!?"

1535. "Just leave everything to me."

bluffing."

      leap off the building and try to tackle him on the way down."

1538. "A tentacle has wrapped itself around my arm?  I transmute that arm into
      molten rock."  (You give a pc god-like powers and they forget that they
      aren't resistant to heat...)

1539. PC1: "Hmmmm, seems like giant insects..."

      off."

1552. "Is this green stuff on the floor Jell-O?"

      did the vampiric Smurfs come from?"

1554. "Creatures following us, and a funny smell?  I'll cast fireball on them
      anyway.  That should kill them."

1555. "I refuse.  Trolls stink when they burn."

1556. "What are you going to drink? Blood?"

1557. (PCs have just entered a cave filled with orcs. They were hiding
      behind a large stone and had not been spotted):

     PC2 (a knight): "Let's charge them. I want those XP's!"
     PC1: "NO wait, we can't charge them. We do not know if they are
      evil. My God would forbid this instantly!"
     PC2: "Okay" (stepping out from behind the stone and shouts)
      "ARE YOU EVIL???"

1558. "Didn't you say there was only ONE demon here???"

1559. "I wonder who the fellow with the black armour among the Storm Troopers
      is. I'll use the Force to find out."

1560. "What do you mean 'The large shadow in front of me is MOVING.'"

1561. "My magic shield will hold on forever against these arrows, won't it?"

1561. Party read an incantation falsely, which summoned a Balrog:
     Mage: "I read the incantation again. Maybe if we summon another
      Balrog, it'll fight the other one."

1562. "Bible bombs?!" said by the Champions character Blaster after having been
      handed one.

1563. "Let me get this straight. You left the villain where?" said after

1575. "Think of the reputation!"

1576. GM: "They don't want to kill you. They are using Taser."
     PC (panically): "Taser?!?"
     GM: "Yes, they hit... your back pack."
     PC: "Aaaaarrgghhhh."
     GM: "What do you mean 'Aaaaarrgghhhh'?"
     PC: "It contains C-4."

1577. PC: "Stupid thief, I've got a HUNDRED percent chance of finding traps."
     PC: (to DM) "I smash in the door."

1580. "I'm a cyborg and he's just got a little automatic pistol"

1581. "I know I'm driving fast, but my control roll will still be at 85%."

1582. "What'd'ya mean actions have consequences? This is just a game isn't it?"


1583. Bad Guy: "I sense a great power nearby."
     PC: "Hey, It's not me!  I'm just a novice wizard."
