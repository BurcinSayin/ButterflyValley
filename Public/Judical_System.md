# The Judicial System

The Eternal Vanguard has established a comprehensive and adaptable judicial system to ensure justice and order across Golarion. This system is designed to uphold the principles of the Vanguard while respecting local customs and traditions.

## Structure

1. **High Court:** Each kingdom's highest judicial authority, overseen by a Vanguard-appointed Chief Justiciar.
2. **Provincial Courts:** Handle major cases within provinces or large cities.
3. **Local Courts:** Address day-to-day legal matters in smaller communities.

## Justiciars

- Trained legal professionals, vetted and certified by the Eternal Vanguard.
- Serve as judges at all levels, adapting to local customs while upholding Vanguard principles.
- Local rulers may nominate candidates, but final approval comes from Vanguard representatives.

## Legal Code

- [**The Vanguard Codex:**](Vanguard_Codex.md) A core set of laws embodying fundamental Vanguard principles of order, duty, and social welfare.
- **Local Legal Frameworks:** Each kingdom or major region maintains its own comprehensive legal code, addressing specific cultural, economic, and social needs of the area.
- All local laws must be compatible with the Vanguard Codex.

## Trial Process

- Generally follows an inquisitorial system, but accommodates local traditions where necessary.
- Defense advocates are allowed to ensure fair representation.

## Punishments

1. **Correction Centers:** For minor offenses, focusing on realignment with Vanguard and local authority principles.
2. **Community Service:** Emphasizes contribution to society, adaptable to local needs.
3. **Exile or Imprisonment:** For serious crimes, with conditions set by local authorities and approved by Vanguard representatives.

## Appeals Process

- Initial appeals are handled at the local or provincial level.
- Final appeals can be elevated to the kingdom's High Court.
- The Vanguard reserves the right to intervene in cases of significant importance.

## Public Engagement

The Eternal Vanguard encourages citizens to understand and participate in the judicial process:

- Regular showcases demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining order and justice.
- Public education initiatives explain legal rights and responsibilities under the Vanguard Codex and local laws.
