# The History of Golarion: From Earthfall to the Present

## Introduction

Greetings, students of the Eternal Vanguard. Today, we will explore the rich history of our world, Golarion, from the cataclysmic event known as Earthfall to our current era of prosperity and unity under the guidance of the Eternal Vanguard.

## The Age of Darkness (-5293 BV to -4294 BV)

Our journey begins with Earthfall, a catastrophic event that occurred in -5293 BV. Ancient records speak of devastating meteorites striking our planet, causing widespread destruction and ushering in a dark age. This period, known as the Age of Darkness, lasted for nearly a thousand years. During this time, our ancestors struggled to survive in a world plunged into chaos and despair.

## The Emergence of Hope (-5000 BV)

In the midst of this darkness, a beacon of hope emerged. The Eternal Vanguard, our guiding light, was formed in -5000 BV. This organization of visionaries began to study ancient wisdom and develop new ways to help the struggling peoples of Golarion.

## The Return of Sunlight (-4294 BV)

After a millennium of darkness, sunlight finally returned to Golarion in -4294 BV. This marked the end of the Age of Darkness and the beginning of a new era of recovery and growth. The Eternal Vanguard, having established itself during the dark times, was well-positioned to offer aid and guidance to the recovering societies.

## The Golden Age of the Vanguard (-3700 to -3200 BV)

As Golarion continued to heal, the Eternal Vanguard's influence grew significantly. This period, known as the Golden Age of the Vanguard, saw the implementation of groundbreaking public works and social welfare programs. These initiatives earned the Vanguard great loyalty from the common people and established it as a major power in the Inner Sea region.

## Challenges and Growth (-3200 to -1000 BV)

Over the next two millennia, the Eternal Vanguard faced various challenges as rival nations and factions emerged. However, these challenges only served to strengthen the Vanguard's resolve and refine its approaches to governance and social welfare.

## The Time of Troubles (-1000 BV to 1 AV)

The millennium leading up to the Vanguard Calendar's year 0 was a period of great conflict and upheaval across Golarion. During this time, the Eternal Vanguard faced its greatest challenges but ultimately emerged victorious.

## The Triumph of the Vanguard (1 AV)

The year 1 AV marks the Triumph of the Vanguard, when our organization defeated its rivals and consolidated its power. This momentous event ushered in a new era of peace, prosperity, and progress for all of Golarion.

## Foundation of Vanguard City (1 AV)

In the same year as its triumph, the Eternal Vanguard established Vanguard City on the Isle of Unity. This grand metropolis became the new center of civilization in the Inner Sea region and remains the heart of our global community to this day.

## The Great Revision (1 to 100 AV)

The century following the Vanguard's triumph was a period of significant social and political changes. The Vanguard implemented sweeping reforms across Golarion, laying the foundation for our current society.

## The Age of the Vanguard (100 to 1000 AV)

Under the Vanguard's wise rule, Golarion entered a new golden age. Our principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice became the governing ideology across the world. Vanguard City flourished as the undisputed capital of our global civilization.

## The Era of Eternal Guidance (1000 to 3000 AV)

As centuries passed, the Eternal Vanguard's rule became more established and structured. The leadership of the Vanguard evolved into a system where power and wisdom were passed down through generations of capable leaders.

## The Present Era: The Stagnant Era (3000 AV to Present)

In our current time, often referred to as the Stagnant Era, Golarion enjoys a period of stability and order under the Vanguard's absolute rule. Our society has become highly structured and resistant to unnecessary change, focusing instead on maintaining the prosperity and harmony we have achieved.

## Conclusion

As we reflect on this journey through time, we can see how the Eternal Vanguard has guided our world from the brink of destruction to the pinnacle of civilization. It is our duty, as citizens of this great society, to uphold the principles that have brought us this far and to continue working towards an even brighter future.

Remember, students: through unity, duty, and progress, we ensure the eternal prosperity of Golarion under the wise guidance of the Eternal Vanguard.
