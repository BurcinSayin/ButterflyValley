# Your Place in the World of the Eternal Vanguard

Welcome to Golarion in the year 5000 AV (After Vanguard). You were born during a time known as "The Stagnant Era," a period marked by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. As a child blessed - or perhaps cursed - with the "Deja Vu" ability, your life has been far from ordinary. 

## The Eternal Vanguard

The Eternal Vanguard is the sole governing power in Golarion. They rose to prominence centuries ago, guiding humanity through tumultuous times. Over the years, they established a firm grip on society, shaping it according to their principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice.

The Vanguard is led by the Grand Arbiter, a figure revered for their wisdom and dedication to the greater good. Beneath the Grand Arbiter is the Council of Stewards, a group of senior leaders who oversee the daily operations of the Vanguard. In each region, a Regional Advocate represents the Vanguard's interests, while local chapters are managed by Wardens of the People. 

The Vanguard's influence can be seen in every aspect of life. They control education, dictating what is taught in schools and universities. They manage the economy, ensuring that resources are distributed according to their vision of fairness and equality. They are the arbiters of justice, with Justiciars overseeing the legal system.

## Life Under the Vanguard

For most citizens, life under the Vanguard is all they have ever known. The Vanguard's principles of freedom, duty, and social welfare are instilled in children from a young age. While individual liberty is valued, it exists within a framework of societal responsibility and adherence to Vanguard ideals.

The Vanguard encourages citizens to pursue their interests and ambitions, but always with the greater good in mind. Freedom of expression is permitted, though there are understood boundaries - constructive criticism is welcomed, but challenges to the fundamental structure of society are discouraged.

Society is structured to provide opportunities for personal growth and achievement, but always within the context of one's duty to the community. Social mobility is possible through hard work and dedication to Vanguard principles. The Vanguard's decisions, while open to respectful debate, are ultimately considered to be in the best interest of all.

Despite the limitations, many citizens find fulfillment in their roles, seeing their work as contributing to a greater purpose. The Vanguard's emphasis on social welfare ensures that basic needs are met, allowing individuals to focus on personal development and societal contribution.

However, there are those who yearn for more. Whispers of discontent occasionally surface, with some individuals questioning whether the balance between freedom and control truly serves the people's best interests. Such thoughts, while not openly prohibited, are often kept private, as the Vanguard's influence reaches into all aspects of daily life.

## Your Unique Situation

As a child with the "Deja Vu" ability, you have always been different. Your episodes of déjà vu are vivid and frequent, often leaving you with a sense of unease. You can't shake the feeling that the world is not as it should be, that something is amiss.  

The Vanguard took a keen interest in you from a young age. They claimed it was for your own wellbeing, that your abilities made you unique in a world of conformity. Your parents, loyal citizens of the Vanguard, did not resist when you were taken into "protective" custody for education.

## Defiance and Imprisonment

Despite the Vanguard's best efforts, you couldn't ignore the growing sense that something was fundamentally wrong with the world. The more they tried to mold you into a loyal servant, the more you resisted.

Your rebellious nature did not go unnoticed. The Justiciars grew increasingly frustrated with your lack of compliance, and their methods became harsher and more punitive. Eventually, they deemed you a lost cause and a potential threat to their order.

As a result, you now find yourself in a high-security prison, designed specifically for individuals like you who have dared to defy the Vanguard. Here, the Vanguard hopes to keep you isolated and controlled, preventing you from spreading your dangerous ideas and disrupting their carefully crafted society.
