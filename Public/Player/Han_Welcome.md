# Welcome to Golarion, Han Nightveil

## Your World

Welcome to Golarion in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard), a world shaped by the benevolent rule of the Eternal Vanguard. You were born during "The Stagnant Era," a time of established order and societal stability. As an elf blessed with the "Deja Vu" ability and a deep commitment to Vanguard ideals, your life has taken an extraordinary path.

## Your Background

You are Han Nightveil, a 70-year-old elf originally from Iadara's Refuge, and a scion of the influential House Nightveil. Your family is known for its role in espionage and border protection, maintaining a network of spies both within and outside the enclave. Lord Vaeris Nightveil, your father, leads the house with a reputation for unwavering dedication to the enclave's security and the Vanguard's vision.

You are one of four children:

1. Thaelar Nightveil, your elder brother (age 95), the heir apparent to House Nightveil.
2. Lyria Nightveil, your elder sister (age 85), deeply involved in the family's clandestine operations.
3. You, Han Nightveil (age 70), gifted with the "Deja Vu" ability and a strong sense of justice.
4. Aelindra Nightveil, your younger sister (age 60), who was sent to Vanguard City for education two years before you.

Growing up, you've always felt a strong bond with Aelindra and a deep commitment to protecting the freedoms granted by the Vanguard. Your protective instincts towards her sometimes put you at odds with your family's methods, even as you all work towards the same goal of a stable and prosperous society.

## Your Education and Training

At the age of 50, you began your studies at Starfall Academy in Iadara's Refuge. This marked the beginning of your journey towards becoming a Champion of The People. Your natural inclination towards justice and protection, combined with your faith in Vanguard principles, set you on a different path from your family's traditional roles.

Ten years ago, at the age of 60, you were transferred to Vanguard City to continue your education and training. This move came two years after your sister Aelindra was sent there, a fact that both relieved and concerned you.

## Your Unique Ability and Aspirations

You possess the "Deja Vu" ability, which manifests as vivid and frequent episodes of déjà vu. These experiences often provide you with unique insights that strengthen your resolve to protect the freedoms and welfare of the people. The Eternal Vanguard recognized your potential from a young age, guiding you towards the path of becoming a Champion of The People.

## Recent Events

Two years before your transfer to Vanguard City, Aelindra was sent there for education. In the weeks leading up to her departure, she had been talking about vivid dreams filled with imagery of stars, butterflies, and distant travels. These dreams seemed to both excite and unsettle her. Your family and the Vanguard authorities deemed it best for her to receive specialized education in Vanguard City.

Your protective instincts towards Aelindra, combined with your own experiences with the "Deja Vu" ability, left you with mixed feelings about her transfer. When you were sent to Vanguard City two years later, you hoped to reconnect with her and ensure her wellbeing.

## Strange Experiences in Vanguard City

During your time in Vanguard City, you underwent some unusual experiences. After certain health examinations, you often felt strangely ill, with symptoms unlike any sickness you'd experienced before. Following some particularly intense training sessions, you suffered from severe headaches and vivid, unsettling nightmares.

These experiences left you feeling disoriented and uneasy. The nightmares were especially troubling, filled with fragmented and confusing images that felt oddly real. Sometimes, you would wake up with a sense that something important had happened, but you could never quite grasp what it was.

You found it difficult to talk about these experiences with others. When you tried, the Vanguard officials dismissed your concerns, assuring you that such reactions were normal for someone undergoing advanced education and training. Despite their reassurances, you couldn't shake the feeling that something more was happening, even if you couldn't put your finger on exactly what it was.

## Growing Unease and Current Situation

Throughout your time in Vanguard City, you've experienced a growing sense of unease about certain Vanguard principles. Despite your upbringing and commitment to justice, you've found yourself questioning aspects of the Vanguard's methods and ideologies. This internal conflict has been deeply troubling, as it goes against everything you've been taught to believe.

Your doubts led to increasing tension with Vanguard authorities. Despite your family's influence and your potential as a Champion of The People, the Vanguard ultimately deemed you a risk.

Now, at 70 years old, you find yourself in a high-security prison. You've been here for about a year, placed in this facility designed for individuals who have dared to defy the Vanguard. Here, they hope to keep you isolated and controlled, preventing you from spreading your "dangerous" ideas and questioning their authority.

This turn of events has been shocking and disorienting. You struggle to reconcile your long-held beliefs about the Vanguard's benevolence with your current circumstances and the unsettling experiences that led to your imprisonment.

## Your Abilities and Inner Conflict

As an aspiring Champion of The People, you've developed combat skills and a nascent connection to divine magic. However, your imprisonment has strained this connection, leaving you uncertain about the source and nature of your powers.

Your "Deja Vu" ability continues to provide insights, but now these glimpses often add to your confusion and doubt about the world around you. You find yourself torn between your ingrained loyalty to Vanguard principles and the growing suspicion that all is not as it seems.

Remember, Han, that you are at a crucial point in your journey. Your unique abilities, your conflicted feelings about Vanguard principles, and your experiences in Vanguard City have led you to this challenging situation. As you navigate the trials ahead, you must grapple with your sense of justice, your loyalty to your family (especially your concern for Aelindra), and your growing doubts about the true nature of the Vanguard's rule.
