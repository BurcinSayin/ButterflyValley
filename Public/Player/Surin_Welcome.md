# Welcome to Golarion, Surin Thell'quassir

## Your World

Welcome to Golarion in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard), a world shaped by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. You were born during "The Stagnant Era," a time of rigid structure and resistance to change. As an elf blessed - or perhaps cursed - with the "Deja Vu" ability, your life has taken an extraordinary path.

## Your Background

You are Surin Thell'quassir, a 70-year-old elf originally from Iadara's Refuge. Your father, Faelyn Thell'quassir, is the Forest Warden of the enclave, a tall, lean elf with long silver hair and keen forest-green eyes. For the first 50 years of your life, you learned from him about the ways of the forest, tracking, survival, and the importance of preserving elven traditions.

Your mother disappeared under mysterious circumstances when you were very young. Your father rarely speaks of her, his eyes clouding with a mix of pain and confusion when you ask about her.

## Your Unique Ability

You possess the "Deja Vu" ability, which manifests as vivid and frequent episodes of déjà vu. These experiences often leave you with a sense of unease and a feeling that the world is not as it should be. The Eternal Vanguard took a keen interest in you from a young age, claiming it was for your own wellbeing.

## Your Education

At the age of 50, you began attending Starfall Academy in Iadara's Refuge. Despite your father's initial reluctance, he recognized the necessity of formal education. During your breaks and holidays, Faelyn intensified your home education in elven lore and traditions, teaching you to question information subtly and think critically.

## Your Training and Abilities

Despite the Vanguard's attempts to mold you, your father's influence and your own innate abilities have shaped your skills in unexpected ways. Your time in the wilds with Faelyn honed your survival instincts and archery skills, laying the groundwork for your ranger-like abilities. However, the rigorous physical training imposed by the Vanguard has also made you a formidable close-quarters combatant.

You've developed a unique fighting style that blends elegant elven archery traditions with the more practical and adaptable techniques of a front-line fighter. Your natural dexterity serves you well, whether you're loosing arrows from your composite longbow or engaging in melee combat. You've even learned to maintain pinpoint accuracy at close range, a skill that has proven useful in the confined spaces of your current imprisonment.

Your "Deja Vu" ability sometimes manifests in combat, giving you split-second insights that have saved your life more than once. This uncanny awareness, combined with your diverse combat training, makes you a versatile and unpredictable opponent.

## Your Transfer to Vanguard City

At the age of 60, you were transferred to Vanguard City for what was described as "better education." This move deeply worried your father, though he tried to hide his concern. The transfer marked a significant change in your life, taking you far from the familiar forests of Iadara's Refuge to the heart of Vanguard power.

## Strange Experiences in Vanguard City

During your time in Vanguard City, you underwent some unusual experiences. After certain health examinations, you often felt strangely ill, with symptoms unlike any sickness you'd experienced before. Following some particularly intense training sessions, you suffered from severe headaches and vivid, unsettling nightmares.

These experiences left you feeling disoriented and uneasy. The nightmares were especially troubling, filled with fragmented and confusing images that felt oddly real. Sometimes, you would wake up with a sense that something important had happened, but you could never quite grasp what it was.

You found it difficult to talk about these experiences with others. When you tried, the Vanguard officials dismissed your concerns, assuring you that such reactions were normal for someone undergoing advanced education and training. Despite their reassurances, you couldn't shake the feeling that something more was happening, even if you couldn't put your finger on exactly what it was.

## Your Defiance and Current Situation

Despite the Vanguard's efforts to mold you into a loyal servant, you couldn't ignore the growing sense that something was fundamentally wrong with the world. Your rebellious nature and lack of compliance frustrated the Justiciars, and their methods became increasingly harsh.

Now, at 70 years old, you find yourself newly imprisoned in a high-security facility. You've just arrived, placed in this prison designed for individuals who have dared to defy the Vanguard. Here, they hope to keep you isolated and controlled, preventing you from spreading your "dangerous" ideas.

## Your Father's Influence

Throughout your life, your father has instilled in you a deep appreciation for elven heritage and a subtle skepticism towards outside influences. As you face this new chapter in your life, you carry with you the lessons, both spoken and unspoken, that Faelyn has imparted over the past seven decades.

Remember, Surin, that you are the product of both your unique abilities and the careful guidance of your father. As you navigate the challenges ahead, draw strength from your elven heritage, the critical thinking skills Faelyn has nurtured in you, and your own resilience in the face of the Vanguard's attempts to control you.
