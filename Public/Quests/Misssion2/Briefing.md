# Eoghan Moonseer Divination Mission
This mission is related to a divination given by Eoghan Moonseer. Since it is bound by the core powers of Bastion, travel time and objectives are ambigious. Examination of Temporaj Jump chamber indicates that the travel time is near 4700 AV and mission time is about 1 month.

## Divination
In Freedom's grasp, a voice of chrome,\
Offers gilded chains called 'home.'\
Through open palms and silver tongue,\
A spider's web is slowly spun.\
When debts pile high and hope runs dry,\
The truth behind his metal eye,\
Must be revealed before the last\
Poor soul is bound unto his cast.\
Time grows short as power grows tall,\
Expose the voice before all fall

## Freedom Town Relation
Freedom is a town in the border regions of Ustalav and Belkzer Hold (a.k.a Freedom Town). Founded at 4694 AV with no Eternal Vanguard presence. Freedom Town has grown into a small community of all those needing to evade the law and willing to make a hard life among the dangers of the region. Tribute is regularly paid in food, gold, and persons to the local orc tribes and the government in Vigil has so far turned a blind eye to the problem

## Whisperin Tyrant Recent Campaign Info
References to "grasp", "bound souls", "growing power" etc. and the location of Freedom Town may be interpeted as relation to Whispering Tyrant. At the behest of Deja Vu temporal field agents, information about Whispering Tyrant's latest exploits (a.k.a Tyrants's Grasp events) summarized below. Since there is no written record in original Bastion resources, all info compiled from Liberators Dawn reports.

2. Coverage Gaps: Organization's information gathering primarily focused on civilian impact and military movements
3. Verification Status: Most major events independently verified by multiple sources within their network
4. Notable Omissions: No information about temporal anomalies or magical specifics beyond visible effects

### Strategic Value Assessment
- Liberators' Dawn intelligence provides valuable verification of public timeline
- Organization's widespread network offers comprehensive coverage of societal impact
