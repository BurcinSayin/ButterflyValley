# Crimson Relic Hunters

## The Team

### Varik "Shadowblade" Katner
A tall, weathered human man with military bearing, Varik seems to be the group's unofficial leader. Despite his stern appearance, he shows a dry sense of humor over dinner, particularly when teasing Finn about his latest close calls. His clever tactical insights pepper his stories, and you notice he has an impressive knowledge of regional history.

### Zora Flamehearth
This imposing half-orc woman dominates any space she's in, but not just through her physical presence. She speaks passionately about preserving historical artifacts and seems to have a particular interest in items related to tribal heritage. Throughout dinner, she shares fascinating stories about ancient tribal customs and their significance.

### Elara Whisperwind
An elegant elven woman with silver-streaked dark hair, Elara brings an academic's perspective to the conversation. She frequently offers historical context to the group's discoveries, though you notice she sometimes holds back, as if carefully choosing what information to share. Her eyes light up when discussing magical theory and ancient lore.

### Finn Quickfingers
This cheerful halfling keeps the mood light with his animated storytelling and quick wit. He seems to relish recounting tales of narrow escapes from ancient traps and sealed tombs. While his stories might sound like boasts, the others' reactions suggest they're mostly true â€“ if perhaps slightly embellished.

### Grondar Stonefist
The dwarven fighter is the quietest of the group, but when he speaks, the others listen. His expertise in geology and ancient dwarven construction techniques becomes apparent as he explains how they navigate old ruins safely. He has a particular interest in uncovering the truth about his clan's history.

## Their Work

The Crimson Relic Hunters present themselves as independent scholars and adventurers who explore the ancient ruins scattered throughout the Immenwood. They emphasize the importance of preserving historical artifacts and knowledge, suggesting that too much of Golarion's history has already been lost to time.
