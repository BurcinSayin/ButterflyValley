## The Ritual of Eternal Unity

The Ritual of Eternal Unity is a sacred ceremony performed by the Eternal Vanguard to welcome new members into their ranks and bestow upon them the ability to channel the collective spiritual energy of the Vanguard's faithful. This solemn and joyous occasion marks a significant milestone in a devotee's journey within the Vanguard.

While this ritual is the primary means by which Vanguard followers gain the ability to cast divine spells, it is worth noting that a very small number of exceptionally blessed individuals or prodigies may manifest the ability to channel divine magic without undergoing the ritual. These rare cases are often seen as specially favored by the collective spirit of the Vanguard, and their abilities are typically discovered at a young age. Such individuals are exceedingly uncommon, perhaps only one or two in a generation, and are often fast-tracked for important roles within the Vanguard hierarchy.
