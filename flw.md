		   Canonical List of Famous Last Words

		     (Roleplaying : Fantasy and SF)

 Hundreds of brave characters lost their lives during thousands of roleplaying
 sessions leaving us their last words. We'll never forget them. Rest In Peace.

0001-"Let's go in."

0002-"Let's not go in."

0003-"I follow them."

0004-"I stab the dragon and tell it to get off me."

0005-"I drink the bottle marked POISON on the off-chance that it's the
      extra-healing potion."

0006-"I kill it."

0007-"Let me handle this."

0008-"Whaddya mean, a pentagram only has FIVE sides?"

0009-"What a useless scroll. It just says, HASTUR HASTUR HASTUR over and over
      again..."

0010-"Click?? ...This doesn't come with ammo?"

0011-"Why is your torch flame turning blue?"

0012-"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH"

0013-"Trust me."

0014-"I never get lost."

0015-(A corridor ahead is full of brown mold)
    "I cast Fireball down the hall, then send my fire elemental to investigate."

0016-"Dammit, this thing won't die!"

0017-a)"I bet without Mjolnir you're a real wuss."
     b)"He looks like a wuss to me."

0018-"He hit me for HOW MUCH?????"

0019-"They're only kobolds!"

0020-"Hey, this chest just bit me!"

0021-"I try to move silently in plate armor..."

0022-"I didn't find any traps !!"

0023-"Wonder what this button does ?"

0024-"Don't worry, he is probably just first level."

0025-"This 250' wall has so many holes, it should be easy to climb."

0026-"I'll just close my eyes and walk up to the dracolisk holding up my mirror"

0027-"Can I eat this green slime?"

0028-"I'll just walk up to the dragon invisibly"

0029-"Why is this man speaking in sign language?"

0030-"This type of undead can't drain levels"

0031-"I'll open the door, sneak up on him from behind and backstab him!"

0032-"We are in luck! The dragon is sleeping"

0033-"That's only a statue"

0034-"There is no trap on the door, so let's open it"

0035-"Look, behind you!!!"  Said by a gnome(pc) to an ogre as a disliked
      parttymember crept up.  End of the other member.

0036-"I have this dungeon at home, I know where everything is!"

0037-"Don't worry, the DM won't hose me"

0038-"We'll untie the prisoners and lock them in the closet."

0039-"Why can't we take Clarissa (Disguised evil high priestess) with us?"

0040-"How much will you give me for this idol I found (cursed)?"

0041-"I'm not powerful enough, can't you just give me second level."

0042-"Don't I get the faerie fire bonus on my parry."

0043-Star Wars:"Stormtroopers can't hit a Wampa at this dist..."

0044-Traveller:"Who took the battery out of my grav belt?"

0045-"They're wearing blue robes?  They must be Druids.  Roll for initiative,
      suckers."  (At which point the polymorphed Bone Devils ate him.)

0046-"I see HOW MANY wights?!"  (from the crypts of Ravenloft)

0047-"Don't worry, wyvern don't attack unless they're provoked."

0048-"You watch the door, I'll take out the Gas Spore (Beholder) that's guarding
      the treasure."

0049-"A Nightmare, huh?  I'll attack for one round and prepare to run."

0050-"I'll take off my armor so I'm silent and slip past the dragon."

0051-"They need a twenty to hit me, I'm invincible"

0052-"Don't worry sir, we can handle it."

0053-"You jump down and distract him, and I'll shoot him."

0054-NPC: "Lets drop our weapons and talk."
     PC : "Okay!"

0055-"We killed all monsters on this level."

0056-"I've been here before. There are no traps in this section."

0057-"What do you mean 18 meter long crocodile--you just said crocodile."
 
0058-"Well ...., I'll touch it again"

0059-"I attempt to disbelieve."

0060-"I cast a fireball" (into a 10'x10'x10' room)

0061-"I know if I draw a card I'll get the VOID."

0062-GM:"You're very lucky, you all don't know how lucky you are! Save or take
         210 points of damage"

0063-GM:"You don't get your +5 for being a dwarf, because it's special bodak
         power"

0064-" It's OK, I trust her..." ... *BOOM!!!!!!*


0065-"Stand back you wimps.  I'll kill it." 

0066-"Oops."

0067-"OK! I moon the Balrog!"

0068-"My first arrow MISSED the magic-user pointing at me?? OK, I shoot again!"

0069-"Where'd that thief go now?"

0070-"Trap? What trap?"

0071-"So what?"

0072-"Don't be silly.  If this was really the ship's "Self-Destruct Button",
      do you think they'd leave it lying around where anyone could press it?"

0073-"Hmmm...the sign on the door says, "AIRLOCK".  I wonder what's inside."

0074-"You're all a bunch of wimps!!  I'll prove to you myself that an entire
      orc stronghold is no match for your average barbarian."

0075-"All right, we're in an unexplored dungeon in total darkness with no
      light sources or infravision...Hey, I know!!  Let's yell and scream a lot 
      so we can locate each other by sound!!"

0076-"I'm going to kill our captives anyway, and I don't give a damn
      whether the other goody-good PC's like it or not."

0077-"Y'know, since our druid's been so obnoxious, it would probably
      serve him right if we set his precious forest on fire."

0078-"A clever bluff, Agent N42, but not clever enough.  You see, right
      away I recognized your `pistol' as a cleverly disguised
      cigarette lighter."

0079-"A creature with two BABOON heads on a scaly REPTILIAN body?  With
      TENTACLES for arms?  Hunh.  Must be some stupid wizard's magical
      construct. Let's kill it."

0080-"Yes, it's true I humiliated the DM in front of the debating team
      Wednesday, but he's much too broad-minded to take it out on my
      character."

0081-"OK, O Mighty Odin, as long as you're not gonna answer my prayers,
      I'm gonna tell ya what I REALLY think of ya!"

0082-"I drop trough and expose myself to the arch-mage as a gesture
      of contempt."

0083-"Well, guys, I'm sorry my activities in the last town got us all
      tarred and feathered, but you're not going to hold that against me,
      are you?"

0084-"No, I'm sure there's some stipulation that says a disintegrate spell
      won't work if the spellcaster casts it on himself.  Here, I'll
      prove it."

0085-"Oops, I spilled flaming oil on my beard.  I'd better wash it off
      after we kill this fire lizard."

0086-"Well, we know he's LAWFUL evil, so he should keep his word when he
      promised not to betray us."

0087-"So I'm safely across the pit?  Whew!  For a minute there I was
      worried that you might remember my encumbrance penalties."

0088-"Well, as long as I've stumbled into Princess Savitra's bedroom, I
      might as well try to seduce her."

0089-"Thank God!!  A hobgoblin camp up ahead!  Maybe they can help heal
      our wounded!"

0090-"Don't worry!  The chances of me blowing a climb walls roll twice,
      at my level, are infinitesimal."

0091-"All right, I jump...Now on the way down, I activate my ring of
      feather fall...no, wait, didn't I lend it to Jim?"

0092-"So you're Tiamat, huh?  Are you evil?  Yes?  Would you like
      to convert?"

0093-"I cast a `gate' spell and gate in the Iraqi Air Force."

0094-"Well, *I* trust our party thief, and if he says this door isn't
      trapped, that's good enough for me."

0095-"Well, I didn't much like this character, anyway...Here goes
      nothing..."


0096-"I swing the Toxic Avenger's mop at the grenade so I can bat it
      across the room at the aliens...Wait!  Isn't that grenade
      Contact Fused ???"

0097-"All right, I guess Toronaga's right.  There can't possibly be
      anything on the other side of this airlock.  Why not open the
      damned thing."

0098-"Whistling sounds?  Naw, they can't have a grenade launcher!"

0099-"Okay, there's nothing guarding the bridge.  I go through the door
      and find the helm."

0100-"They can't possibly outflank us.  We have a multi-scanner!"

0101-"Come on!  Arrows versus Kevlar?"

0102-"What do you mean Tsu Han's pilotting the shuttle?  Does he even
      have Insystem Pilot?  WHY ARE YOU SMILING AND SHAKING YOUR HEAD?"

0103-"So that giant fell into the pit?  I'll jump over it and get
      his treasure."

0104-"Oh, that sorceress looked a little pale when she examined the
      mirror which has the pentagram in front of it on the floor.  I
      think I'll break the mirror."

0105-"It's not trapped, you just want it to yourself."{He still got it
      for himself.}
     
0106-"Me first Me first."

0107-"Dinosaur? Hey, no problem, right Balinor?"

0108-"You call yourself a barbarian, you son of a witch ?"

0109-To powerful demon:  "Try me sh*t breath!"

0110-To sleeping dragon: "Oops, sorry...didn't mean to disturb you."

0111-"Come on, we haven't found any so far."

0112-Ranger: "What do I see?"
     DM:"Do you remember the trap that killed Indy's guide in Raiders
         of the Lost Ark?"

0113-"Diamonds ... Gold... Saphires !!! Terry! Terry, we're rich, we're
      rich, we're fabulously wealthy !!!!  ...Terry .....  Terry ??"

0114-"Let's walk this way."

0115-"Hey folks, follow me, I remember the way to the dungeon exit."

0116-"I never get to have any fun!"

0117-"You mean they get to use the critical hit chart too?"

0118-"Hey, I know a dragon when I see one."

0119-"What do you mean the whole room we're in detects as a trap?"

0120-"Hey you! Frost Giant! How's the weather up there?"

0121-"Just watch, I bet I get the one item that's cursed."

0122-"What does it mean when you botch an initiative roll?"

0123-"Don't worry.  I know what I'm doing!"

0124-"Stop!"

0125-"A sign labeled `pit'?  I walk up to it."

0126-"No problem.  That's easy!"

0127-"Hey, I found it.  I'm keeping it."

0128-"I think we'll have to reason with him."

0129-"Hah! I'm not dead yet.  I still have five hit points."

0130-"Oh, no.  We're being rescued.  How embarrassing!"

0131-"Yeah, I know it's dangerous, but think of the experience
      points."

0132-"I stand right underneath the Fire Giant and point my wand
      straight up."

0133-"Don't worry.  I've got a plan."

0134-"They can't see me.  I'm invisible!"

0135-"I wonder what's in here?"

0136-"He wouldn't try that trick again!"

0137-"My two mutations? ...But I've only one!"

0138-"Just because you're a dragon doesn't mean you can push ME
      around."

0139-"They don't look so tough."

0140-"I'm SURE there are no traps."

0141-GM: "FIVE...FOUR...THREE...TWO..."
     PC: "I look for the light switch."

0142-"What do you mean trolls regenerate!?!"

0143-"Here kitty, kitty, kitty..."

0144-"I'll open it."

0145-"It seems easy enough"

0146-"I think he can be trusted."

0147-"Those noises are probably nothing."

0148-"I'll pull the lever."

0149-"Money!"

0150-"Magic is for wimps."

0151-"Oh.  He'll miss.  Just look at my AC."

0152-"Oh no!  Let's go help them!"

0153-"Run away!"

0154-"I want to kill something."

0155-"All clear, guys."

0156-"Gummy werebears? They should be cake to kill once they turn
      human."

0157-"Wait a minute, didn't the old man say something about a curse?"

0158-"Hey, where'd all the big spiders come from?"

0159-"Okay, Ed, your underwear explodes!"

0160-"Bob, you have any grenades left? Throw me one..."

0161-"AGAIN!?!?!"

0162-"He shot out my eye? Okay, I tear out my other eye and throw it
      at him as a gesture of defiance."

0163-"I pull the metal ring out of the sphere."(Recognize a Holy
      Hand Grenade?)

0164-"This is a push-over dungeon."

0165-a)"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea."
     b)"I told him it was a bad idea."

0166-"I'll use my taunt skill."

0167-"Your mother was a Gully Dwarf."

0168-"My God will protect me."

0169-"You wouldn't dare!"

0170-"Hey, we're out! We're safe!"

0171-"I'll try it on."

0172-"C'mon!  We're a team!"

0173-"You don't look like a mage!"

0174-"It'd be stupid to trap this!"

0175-"I'll kick the door in!"

0176-"It could be dangerous!"

0177-"Here, hold this rope while I go down."

0178-a)"I thought you brought the food!"
     b)"I thought you brought the antidote!"

0179-"Well, if you didn't belch, who did?"

0180-"Isn't there anything exciting in this dungeon?" (said to GM)

0181-"Uh guys? Hello? Anyone?"

0182-"Dragons give you a lot of Exp."

0183-"I know an illusion when I see one."

0184-"Who's the bitch with the spiders?" (ahhh! the infamous Lloth)

0185-"I sit on the pale lady with the funny teeth." (Ahhh! the
      infamous vampire)

0186-"Mysterious shadows in the room? I'm not scared --- you can't
      spook me!"

0187-"There's a smell of gas, huh? Well, my lantern is hooded. It ought
      to be safe."

0188-"Take off my armor and try to swim? Forget it --- I worked hard
      to get this +3 plate mail. Besides, the DM never lets anyone
      die --- he wouldn't let me drown, would he?"

0189-"I cast a lightning bolt at the ochre jelly."

0190-"Lightning bolts don't ricochet off stone walls, do they?"

0191-"A ballista? What's that? How many dice of damage does it do?"
     {Twenty.It's like a crossbow, only MUCH larger.}

0192-"So what if he calls the guard? A backwater town like this can't
      have a very big militia."

0193-"Only six inches long? Ha... Wait, you don't mean six _scale_ inches,
      do you?" {said in miniature-figures-game. Character itself
      was 3/4" high.}

0194-"...and then I... Uh, guys? Why are looking at me like that? Guys?"
      {After using a spell called "Polymorph Other" }

0195-"What do you mean, `It doesn't work' ?" {Item with no more
      charges left.}

0196-"Oh these, I've fought them before..."

0197-"Then I'll hit him back!" {spoken at the start of a bar brawl.}

0198-"I'm bored..."

0199-"Quick!  What did that scroll say ?"

0200-"How did he dissappear like that ?" {About a hostile warrior with
      a ring of invisibility and two attacks per round.}

0201-"I'll try to pick his pockets." {Pockets belonged to a level
      30 mage.}

0202-"Maybe we should just kill him."

0203-"Read it to me." {It was a fireball scroll.}

0204-"You mean there's more ?" {About undeads which entered the room}

0205-"MAGIC ITEMS!"

0206-"He looks like a sunburnt elf?  Huh."

0207-"I'll light a fire." (In the woods at night (attracted bears)}

0208-"You'd have to be a GOD to smile after that hit!"


0209-GM:"You DID take the swimming skill?" (to a player when character
         fell overboard.)

0210-"I'll stand guard." (Didn't want to enter orc cave.Orcs were out.
      Orcs came back.)

0211-"What do you mean I hear water?" {in a tunnel}


0212-"I bar the door!" {Door opened inward.}

0213-"I'll cover you!"

0214-"Take out a Beholder's eyes, and Bingo!"

0215-"I can't possibly miss..."

0216-"Don't worry, I can hit him!  I can hit him!"

0217-"Shut up, bird!" {to a parrot who happened to be repeating the
      True Name of a demon which subsequently exterminated the party}

0218-"But he has to be our friend!"

0219-"How would you like to have this sword?"

0220-NPC:"Take this ring as a token of my esteem." {This party no longer
          accepts gifts from unknown NPC's.}

0221-PLAYER:"BEGONE THINGS OF EVIL!!!"  REPLY:"Begone thing of good."

0222-"I go through the door... Wait, I check for traps!"

0223-"Don't be silly. That kind of monster NEVER follows you."

0224-"I run up to the monster, throw my magic net over it, and try to
      take the jewel from around its neck." {But nets don't stop
      creatures from biting.}

0225-"Hmmm... odd-colored walls. Well, I touch one." {turned to stone}

0226-"I wonder what the black-and-yellow striped ring above the seat does?"
      { Ejection Seat. No atmosphere and no vacc-suit.}

0227-"What do you mean, vacc-suit proficiency? I thought it was perfectly
      straightforward, like wearing clothes..."
      [From a character attempting to fight hand-to-hand in one.]

0228-"But the directions SAID to `pull pin and throw' !"
         [From a beautifully role-played traveller character from a non-
          technological world. He was given a scout ship survival pack,
          which among other gimcracks, contained concussion grenades.
          When he got in trouble, of course, he pulled the pin out of
          one and threw it ("it" being the pin, naturally)...]

0229-"Uh, what does 'explosive decompression' mean?"

0230-"Why the hell do you always put `Graf' before your name? Is that
      this backward planet's equivalent of `Duke' or something?"

0231-"Don't worry - I have Pilot-7."

0232-"What do you mean `energy weapons are illegal' ?"

0233-"DO NOT OPEN"

0234-"Easy kill."

0235-"I've got you now!"

0236-"Is this one really able to breath fire?"

0237-"Trust me. I know what I'm doing"

0238-"I open the door and see who it is." {in response to a knock on
      the door}

0239-"I jump off the roof - He won't get my last HP then."

0240-"Oh cute!  Look at the fuzzy little cubs!"

0241-"Your armor is too noisy.  Wait here and I'll scout ahead."

0242-"I explain to the ogre that it was an honest mistake."

0243-"Oh, he puts those in all of his dungeons.  It's a gas spore."

0244-"Hubba hubba!  The nymph's taking off her clothes!"

0245-"Whoever did this must be long gone by now."

0246-"Easy, boy.  What's this stupid horse's problem?"

0247-"You mean ...  this ... is the last ... torch?"

0248-"Oh don't worry.  The poisonous ones have orange stripes."

0249-"I really didn't know it was against the law."

0250-"You racist!  They're elves.  So what if they're black?"

0251-"This flickering torch light is playing tricks on my eyes.
      It almost seemed as though that chest moved by itself."

0252-"Demogorgon."

0253-"What's the duration of this Fly spell?"

0254-"I don't understand.  It should be dead by now."

0255-"Finally!  I thought that troll would never die."

0256-"If we look brave and fearless, they won't attack."

0257-"I'de feel better if we had some crampons.  Oh, what the hell,
      let's go for it."

0258-"I wouldn't worry about the thieves' guild -- they don't have a
      clue who did it."

0259-"Aha!  So you're the [killer/spy/vampire]!"

0260-"It doesn't look very fast; we can easily swim across."

0261-"While they're fighting the dragon, I sneak around behind him and
      examine his hoard."

0262-"I wish we had a 10 foot pole.  Oh well."

0263-"Ha ha ha!  Let's put bookworms in his spell research library."

0264-"I rolled a 20.  How could that be a miss?"

0265-"I've got plenty of spells; I don't need to carry a weapon."

0266-"I'm heir to the crown.  They wouldn't dare!"

0267-"Don't you understand?  The odds will be even.  If we can't see them,
      they can't see us."

0268-"Who's bringing up the rear?"

0269-"It's only one wight. The others are just ghouls."

0270-"But [longbows/match locks/nuclear weapons] haven't been invented
      yet..."

0271-"Look, I don't care what you think of her, or her "demonic smile."
      She's hot to trot.  So, if you'll excuse us..."

0272-"I've got better things to do than run your petty errands, your
      highness."

0273-"What?!  I thought you said fifTEEN kobolds."

0274-"It'll be a short ocean voyage.  One week's worth of food and water
      will be enough."

0275-"I won't fall in; I just want a better look at what's down there."

0276-"Ochre jelly?  Ok, everyone, break out the bread and the peanut
      butter."

0277-"Quit clowning around.  Look, whichever one of you is doing that,
      it's not funny."

0278-"Hey!  Where's my components?"

0279-"For some reason I had always imagined that bugbears were somewhat
      smaller."

0280-"A trap?  That's exactly what we're supposed to expect.  I think this
      DM is more imaginative than that."

0281-"After what we took, he won't be able to afford an assassin."

0282-"They're usually not aggressive.  If we leave it alone, it'll leave us
      alone."

0283-"Wanna see my new spell?"

0284-"Something's wrong with my d20."

0285-"That was no healing potion!  I'm gonna kill that swindler!"

0286-"Ha!  That's the oldest trick in the book."

0287-"Hey, Bill, cast a Detect Invisibility, quick.  Bill.  Bill?  Where's Bill?"

0288-"Cover me."

0289-"I think it's asleep."

0290-"Look at the size of those tracks!"

0291-"Can you make out this next rune?  It looks like someone spilled coffee on
      this scroll."

0292-"..23..24..Well, that's the last of his arrows."

0293-"Watch this."

0294-"Well, if I remember correctly, it's AC 7, 3+1 HD, 1d8 damage.  Hmm..."
     <scribble> <scribble>
     "I should defeat him around the 4th round and still have
      about 12.5 hit points left.  Ok, let's rock!"

0295-"No problem!  I'll just cast a ... whoops, I forgot.  I'm just 2nd level,
      aren't I?"

0296-"Did you see that guy's head?  I wonder what did this."

0297-"Damned be him who first cries, 'Hold, enough!'"

0298-"If you cut me down, I will only become more powerful."

0299-"Zoinks!  I sure hope that's just Scooby behind me."

0300-"I ain't afraid of no ghost."

0301-"Geez, I'm kind of low on funds.  Ok, I'll take 500 gp for the healing
      potion."

0302-"I bet it's just an illusion."

0303-"Well, at least I tried...?"

      to land on the back of one of the 12 griffons flying above us."

0901-"I think we can take it down."

0902-"Come on, EVERY evil wizard's tomb has a way out!"

     PC:"I'll sit on the altar."

0923-"Well...I'm unconscious.  At least nothing can happen to me now."

0924-"I'm sick of firing arrows.  I think I'll actually FIGHT this time."

0925-"You mean I lost my +1 sword in the sand pit?  I go back and get it."

0926-"Let's get the old mage's body down from the cross and give him a decent
      burial."

0927-"I pass the time practicing with my Ring of Fire."

0929-"No one can order me around !"

0930-"I knew I should have put more points in DEX."

0931-"Hm, what do you mean the voodoo master has a little puppet in his hand
      that looks a little bit like me."

0932-GM:"You need to save VS. poison or die!"
     PC:"Whew!  I made my save!"
     GM:"OK, you only take 20hp damage!"
     PC:"Oops."

0933-"Hey, look at this huge red rubin on top of the dragon's treasure. This
      one is really beautiful."

0934-PC:"I wanna buy a cyberpig."
     GM: *sigh*

0935-"ssssssssssss....snore....ssssssssssss...snore..."

0936-"Hey, everyone knows animals don't attack druids. So let me talk to
      that giant spider."

0937-"He won't hurt me, I'm wearing my magic breastplate."

0938-"Okay, I jump down that cliff and use my robe of flying..."

0939-"I've got the best perception in this party,and I say this bridge IS safe."

0940-"It's you again. Ha, wait some seconds, this time I'll kill you."

0941-"I'm invisible in his back, I can't possibly miss my firebolt."

      had lost several people in a raid.}

0944-"Ahh, come on, you won't eat me, would you ?!"

0945-"Yeah right...just eat me!"

0946-"If I'm falling down here, I'll be dead." {while climbing a high mountain}

0947-"I'd like to know how these monsters can attack us, they seem to be
      harmless."

0948-"You won't get a second blow, so you better make your first one count,
      jackass!"

0949-"Look - I'm a catburglar. I don't need a gun."

0950-"You don't want to know who I am." {trying to hypnotise the city watchmen}

0951-"It's an honour to meet you, sir. I have always been an admirer of the
      Chinese." {said to the local head of the Yakuza, a Japanese of course.}

0952-"Much will help much." {talking about explosives}

0953-"It's better with too much than too little." {another character talking
      about explosives}

0954-"We're in a tank. They would need a LAW to hit us."

0955-Player:"I'll be back in half an hour. Take care of my character meanwhile."

0957-"Nice tits." {nice *royal* one, of course}

0958-I use 'Basic Electronics' to try and stabilize the shield generator."

0959-"Ghosts doesn't exist."

0960-"Ghosts cannot by any chance follow us to this place."

0961-"Okay - I'll spin around, brush away the gun in my back with my elbow and
      neutralize the guy with the knife with a backwards kick while throwing a
      shaken at the one with the shotgun."

0962-"5 and 6. That was his last shot. Let's get him!" {forgot the other gun}

0963-Look, I know how to make nitroglyserin!"

0964-"There he blows, cap'n Ahab!"

0965-PC1:"What's the name of the captain of the ship where we hired ?"
     PC2:"Captain Ahab or something similar."

0966-"Don't worry, nobody dies on the first encounter."

1127-"Erm...what was the name of this protection spell I learned lately?"

1128-"You bloody joke of a man are supposed to be an assassin?"

1129-"Just watch and wonder how I manage to ride this horse."

1130-"Which colour did healing potions have...red or green?"

1131-"No, this isn't my first trap to deactivate."

1132-"Beware. This is a magic seal. If you read it..."

1133-"I have the most powerful ship in the galaxy. They wouldn't dare
      attack me!"

1134-"Ha! You don't have the guts to shoot me!"

1135-"Say, didn't we have FIVE people in our party?"
     {in a dark cavern, talking to the only other character there}

1136-"What do you mean you forgot your spellbook?"

1137-PC1: "Do you remember that group of trolls whose leader you slayed?"
     PC2: "Yeah..."
     PC1: "Well, don't look now but..."

1138-"You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat!"

1139-"Orcus WHO?"

1140-"My Magic Resistance will protect me from this Earthquake." {underground}

1141-So I dropped and broke the staff of power, I have another..."

1142-"We've plenty of time until the dragon returns."

1143-"Weapons? I'm a spell-caster..."

1144-NPC: "This is the inquisition."
     PC : "What's an inquisition?"

1145-"No trap doors in this sectioooooooooooooo*bump*"

1146-"This potion really tastes good."

1147-"Is it true, that crocodiles do exist in this area?"

1148-"Well, the river isn't too deep here."

1149-"Do you think he spotted us?"

1150-"It is better to go now."

1151-"Is this potion supposed to bubble?"

1152-"Did the old man tell us that the trap is to the right or to the
      left?"

1153-"These mushrooms aren't poisoned."

1154-"Ha. Now your life is in my hands, evil witch."

1155-"Now on to the reward you promised."

1156-"If the tag says 'healing potion', then it IS healing potion!"

1157-"Excuse me, sir. You aren't allowed to carry such heavy weapons
      in this area."

1158-"Ha, you lost again. You are an awful stupid barbarian."

1159-"Well, watchword?"

1160-"Hey, yellow-skinned idiot, don't hop around but fight like a man."

1161-"Why shouldn't I turn over the next leaf?"

1162-"Watch, no trap, no seal, it's safe."

1163-{PC opens a box, finds a sphere inside, sphere starts ticking.}
     PC: "I throw away the sphere."
     ...*boom* {sphere was only the trigger, the box was the bomb}

1164-{PC just being backstabbed}
     GM: "Do you turn around?"
     PC: "No, I keep fighting."

1165-"No wonder that you're extinct." {to dinosaur creature}

1166-"What do you mean the vorpal sword didn't kill the dracolich?"

1167-"Yes!!! The wizard is dead. One more round and he would have killed
      us. What do you mean a Delayed Blast Fireball?"

1168-"I am a Ranger with a 21 Strength. I rip the tree out of the ground and
use it as a club."

1169-PC: "Wow! What a good idea to enter this cave now I'm saved."
     DM: "But it is the cave of a wyvern!"
     PC: "Oh...now I know what this pet is I just found..."

1170-"At least the fire's out."
     {said after a very disasterous crash in the group's ship.  The engine
      section of the ship blew up, starting a fire in the back. 
      Two CP's were wounded, but managed to strap in before we crashed into
      an inland sea.  When we awoke, we found that we had sank about 10 feet
      below the surface of the water, and the hull was leaking.}

1171-"Now where did I put that Thermal Detonator? What's that beeping
      noise?"

1172-GM : "Something small and roundish clinks down the stairs."
     PC1: "Grenade! I catch it."
     PC2: "I catch it."
     PC3: "I catch it."

1173-PC: "I will cast Ghoul-Touch."
     GM: "But you do not have any components."
     PC: "I know..."

1174-GM: "As you enter the cave, you notice it's pitch black and you can't
          see anything..."
     PC: "Hmmm...okay...I close my eyes!"

1175-"I avoid the gargoyle, run and drink from the healing fountain."

1176-"Ok...so Narhal's WASN'T the best spell to cast in the inn..."

1177-PC1: "Hey, I hear something very near around this corner. Christian,
           haven't you got something on the motion tracker ?"
     PC2: "Don't know, I turned off the motion tracker for saving the
           battery power for later."

1178-"I did THAT much damage?" {hit another PC by accident}

1179-"Cover me, I'll take out the mages."

1180-"Twelve knights, seven of us? You'd better get more knights..."

1181-"Oops. I think I forgot to surrender"

1182-"No brain, no pain..." {said to NPC}

1183-"Hmm... This thing looks like a radio controlled bomb. I think I
      better break off its antenna."

1184-"So what? I'm impervious to fire"
     {he was, but the hand grenades at his belt weren't}

1185-"A wall of pudding? Well, I'll eat through it...What do you mean
      the pudding bites back?!!"

1186-"I throw my nuclear hand grenade into the next room."

1187-"I hate the god of lightning and thunder."
     {Standing on a mountaintop, pointing towards heaven with a 20 yards
      long ironpole in thunder}

1188-"Don't worry, I'll have this door open in just a minute."

1189-"OK, we're in the arena.  HOW MANY lions come out of that gate?"

1190-"You can't just leave us here!" {said to party wizard just before he
				      teleported himself out of the trap}

1191-"What do you mean, we can't see where the arrows are coming from?"

1192-"What do you mean, he's still alive?"

1193-"Do you have a problem?  If not, a problem can be arranged for you."

1194-"Can we talk this over?" {no}

1195-"Hmm... No weapon, no more spells...  I hurl silver pieces at the
      wererat."

1196-"Wasn't this elevator going up?"

1197-"Finally, he's out of ammo."

1198-"What's the big deal about a guy in dragonarmor?"

1199-"That's odd.  *Most* lizardmen don't have wings."

1200-"That's odd.  The tracks end here."

1201-"A genie, huh?  Gimme my wishes!"

1202-GM: "It blinds you with a jet of acid."
     PC: "Bah! I locate it by its foul stench!"

1203-{player handles grenade, fumbles, grenade falls to the ground just
      before the PCs' feet}
     "Don't worry guys. It's harmless, it's just a neurostun-grenade."

1204-"Hey Gueso, Man you need to take a bath!...Gueso?"
     {well, it wasn't Gueso...}

1205-"Since these Ogres are under a sleep spell we don't need to kill them."

1206-"I try to jump up and pull the helmet off of the Paladin."

1207-"They've only got maces, how are they going to hurt us?"

1208-PC1: "Climb the tower. If you fall, I'll catch you !"
     PC2: "Ok."

1209-"Which side is the business side of this weapon?"

1210-"I'm going to hide behind the door in such a way that I can hit him,
      but that he cannot hit me."

1211-"Wait! I'm a good spider!" {after being polymorphed into a giant spider}

1212-GM: "You see an island on the horizon."
     PC: "I leap over the side of the ship and swim to it."
     {...in full plate mail}

1213-PC1: "Look over there is a crystal skull."
     PC2: "I run over, take my gloves off and pick the skull up."

1214-"What does 'enimity' mean?"
     {said after drawing the "Enimity between you and a devil card in a
      Deck of Many Things}

1215-"20,000 gold pieces!! I put it in my backpack and run before the
      guard wakes."  {moving is not too easy with such an encumberance}

1216-"Naw! Can't be! Assassins always wear black!"

1217-"Well, first a hills giant, then a fire giant, and after that, a clouds
      giant. There can't be Storm giant, it'll be too obvious, Ok, the exit
      is there, I feel it, let's not rest, and move on..."

1218-"You killed all my friends ! Prepare to face my ... FUMBLE!!!!"

1219-"Let's follow the trail!"

1220-"He couldn't possibly have any spell left!"

1221-"That dragon is too young to breathe fire."

1222-"Don't worry- the dragon has used all of it's breath weapons for today!"

1223-"Awe, look at the cute little fuzzy thing!"

1224-"Don't worry, we can outrun it!"

1225-"Why are those two triangles on the ground like that?" {pentagram}

1226-"Hey guys, wanna play a trick on the mage?"

1227-"What do you mean it's too late?"

1228-a)"But aren't you my friend?"
     b) "But I thought you were my friend!"

1229-"Why do you insist upon looking at my character sheet?"

1230-"I peek around the corner... but not enough to expose my whole head...
      just enough for me to see with my good eye."

1231-"I don't think he had a flame thrower. Hold on, let me check."

1232-"In the name of Tyr, I command you begone foul lich!"
     {said by overzealous first level cleric}

1233-"What do you mean my DEX bonus does not apply?"

1234-"Oh boy! Kudar is back!"
     {Kudar is the hero of the party... or was until he met the
      doppelganger!}

1235-"Don't worry, I removed all the bullets from his gun while he was
      sleeping." {he reloaded it}

1236-"But it's only a little kid!"

1237-PC1: "What do you mean my sword breaks?"
     PC2: "Don't worry, I have another one... now where did I put it?"

1238-"So that's what a Tarrasque looks like!"

1239-"I wonder who's holding that light over there."

1240-{party consists of 4 PCs}
     PC1: "Hand me the lantern"
     PC2: "I don't have it... Mark does"
     PC3: "No I don't... Joe does"
     PC4: "I'm not the one holding it"

1241-"Who knows how to stop a fireball?"

1242-"Why are you guys smiling like that?"

1243-"Hi. Mabye you can help me. I am looking for the thieve's guild..."

1244-"OK guys, here's the plan: In this movie I saw last week..."

1245-"Awe, he's drunk! He wouldn't know if I picked his pocket or his nose!"

1246-"Hey, I was talking to her first!"

1247-PC1: "Mike, are you Hindu?"
     PC2: "No, why?"
     PC3: "Because there is a red dot on your forehead!"

1248-"What do you mean my globe of invulnerability runs out?"

1249-"What do you mean my fly spell runs out?"

1250-PC1: "Shut up!  You are just a silver.  We wanted to talk to a GOLD
           dragon, at least!"
     PC2: "Umm, he doesn't look silver, guys."
     PC3: "Umm, how many metals look like silver but aren't?"
     PC2: "One.  Plat..."

1251-"Trust me, shambling mounds hate lightning."

      around PC1's face}

     PC2: "Quick...I think I've read about these...they're highly vulnerable 
           to fire!"

     {acid}

1253-PC1: "I fireball the Gnolls."
     Player2: "Noooooo!"
     {player2 just lost his character. His new one was to be introduced as 
      the prisoner of the Gnolls, but only the player and GM knew that. It
      was the shortest lived character I've ever seen.}

1254-PC1: "We smell gas?  Joe!  Don't cast any fire spells! Now, what did I
           just tell you?"
     PC2: "Don't cast any fire spells."
     PC1: "Good."
     {5 minutes playing later}
     PC2: "Goblins?  I cast burning hands."

1255-"We'll leave Craig at the farmhouse so he can recover."

1256-GM: "The guard's bullets are riddling the Van."
     PC: "The Briefcase!  It's full of plastic explosives!  I set the timer,
          throw it out the window and tell Dave to floor it."
     GM: "How long do you set the timer for?"
     PC: "Uhh, three seconds."

1257-"Oh no, I forgot to take my parachute..."

1258-"Well, sorry, sir. Didn't mean to hit your wife..."

1259-"Is it possible to pat these beasties?"

1260-"No need for health potions to fight a dragon!"

1261-(with an authoritative voice) : "Get out of here, hands over your head,
      you bast..."

1262-(slightly worried) : "Didn't you lock the car door a few minutes ago?"

1263-"And I say to you that you're gonna let me go out of this hospital!"

1264-"Hi, guys! I'm a bounty hunter too, just like you. And now, tell me
      who pays you to hunt these people?"

1265-"I don't care about your damned team spirit. I don't care about your
      damned discretion imperatives!"

1266-"Whaddayawant? What's wrong with my face?"

1267-"Repeating crossbows do not exist!"

1268-"Lets screw up all of her stuff!"

1269-"Last time I went left, it was a mistake... I go left again!"

     PC: "I open it."
     DM: "You open It?"
     PC: "Yeah."
     (door opened out)

1271- GM (to player): "OK - You may now begin to laugh maniacally."

1272-"I turn myself into water and escape prison by flowing under the
      door of my cell... What do you mean casting time is five years?!"
      (fumble during spell creation)

1273-"I jump into the room and cast a fire ball at the first enemy I see."
      (He saw none, enemy hid behind the door.)

1274-GM: "You should listen to my warnings."
     PC: "Never ever!"

1275-"Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeessssss!"
      (voice from a walky-talky while party was sneaking in enemy camp)

1276-"I hear a beeping sound behind the wall? Well, I jump into the next
      room."

1277-"I am invisible and silent. I sneak up to that statue."
      (the statue with 'detect life' aura)

1278-"I pick the sleeping barbarian's pocket." (success)
     "Only thirty sea-shells?! Well, I put'em back... what do you mean
      I failed my Observation roll???"

1279-"Go ahead. You have the first strike!"

1280-(one of the PCs being possessed by a Demon)
     PC: "Maybe we should kill and later ressurect him..."

1281-"I shall subdue him with a glance from my 'Evil Eye'."

1282-"Please, I have 16 Dex, I don't need magical aids for this one."

1283-"This die is cursed.  Just throw me over that damn bridge."
      (said to a VERY dumb barbarian who didn't recognize sarcasm.)

1284-"DAMN! We got only time for one spell mage, that dragon better not win
      iniatiative!"

1285-"I don't trust you! I know you are Chaotic Evil, I am NOT going to
      leave this room as you suggest!"
      (case of false knowledge, room collapsed)

1286-PC: "Well, I may have stone hands now, but at least I survived."
     GM: "Didn't I tell you?  That fireball took damage from you too."

1287-"Of course we're alert! We're always expecting attack!"

1288-PC to another PC: "What is your problem?  Paladins are cool."
     (1st time Ravenloft player)

1289-"What?  Hill giants?  Since when do hill giants live in caves?"

1290-"We're lighthouse inspectors" (said to a cultist guard at their hq, an
      abandoned lighthouse)

1291-"Deep ones croak when they move, they can't sneak up on..." <thunk> as a
      spear pinned the pc's arm to the wall

1292-"The King in Yellow...(failed mythos role)...He'll help us!"

1293-"I shoot at the boat with my tommy gun..." from the pier, the boat was
      filled with munitions and explosives

1294-GM: "He's standing in the middle of the road, shooting at you."
     PC: "OK, I ram him with my car."
     GM (grinning): "He's climbing up the hood, tearing handholds into the
      hood with his bare hands."
     PC: "I hit the brakes and run him over..."

1295-PC: "I shoot the giant sea monster with the harpoon gun."
     GM: "The spear connects, and the rope reels out into the lake. What is
      the rope tied to?"
     PC: "The car, It won't get far."
     GM: "You're right, it's (the car) being pulled into the lake"
     PC: "But I'm between the car and the..."<roll damage>

1296-PC (to vampire): "Ya wanna go to the beach, work on the tan?"

1297-"Your passport, please?!"

1298-"Sir, you are not allowed to enter this area."

1299-"You and what army?"

1300-"If you were as smart as you think you are, you wouldn't be a cop."

1301-PC1: "Hey, a door. Why don't you knock?"
     PC2: "OK!"

1302-GM:  "Okay, as you finish off the guards you watch the (evil) priests
      finish their ceremony, and a *big* demon appears in the middle
      of their circle."
     PC1: "Okay, I fire at the nearest (evil) priest. (Firing)."
     PC2 (Priest): "Now those priests weren't the only thing to hold back
      that *big* demon - were they?"

1303-GM: "Right then, after you've killed that strange monster (mutated
      rat), you rest... After a while you hear steps round the corner
      further down the corridor... And yes it is Rob-O-COP, only
      trouble is he got his pal Ed-209 with him, what do you do?"
     PC1: "Well if we use the grenade launcher, we can afford to miss by
      a couple of meters - I say we go for it with the launcher."
     PC2: "Right I'll use this grenade (from a box of unmarked grenades).
      I have time to aim right? Allright with the aim I have a better
      chance of hitting right? (Aiming then firing)."
     GM: "Right what you see is this: the TacNuke grenade you just
      launched hits its target, and your spirits are lifted a
      microsecond until you're vaporized along with everything within
      240 meters."

1304-PC1: "Oh, you're saying that with this thought controlled plasma
     thrower all I have to do is point like this (pointing at PC2)
     and say 'Fire'." FOOOOMM.

1305-PC1: (to mission leader at HQ) "But with this map I can't lead them
      (the other players) into an ambush."
     Other Players: "TRAITOR!!!!" ZAP ZAP ZAP.

1306-PC1: (While using belt which generates a force field a round his
      body) "I fire my laser!"
     GM: "You *fire* your laser???"
     PC1: "Yes!"
     GM: "Wow you're in luck! You see your shot leaving the barrel and then
      approximately one inch from the barrel it ricochettes round until it
      hits your chest...And nothing happens.
     PC1: "I fire again!"

1307-PC2: "Right then we'd better use the DocBot" (on PC1).
     DocBot: (Ex-minesweeping bot) "Fine. I'll just check for internal
        injuries." (Opens PC1) "dum da dee...hmm LOOK OUT GRENADE!!!"
        (rips out vital organs while throwing them to a safe
        distance from the PC's).

1308-"Ohh never mind that, that's just a rabbit."

1309-"Well I know we've been there before, but what's the probability
      of them counting on us striking there again?"

1310-"Well I know we've been there twice before, but what's the
      probability of them counting on us striking there again?"

1311-PC1: "Allright I booby-trap my home in case the bad guys come to seek
      me out. And then I leave for the rendez-vouz with the other players."
     Other PC's: "We'll go to PC1's place in case he's still at home."

1312-(in Starwars) "I jump over the grenade and I use the Force."

1313-"I fall to the floor and I feign death."

1314-"The followers of Humakt can't resurrect, I know."

1315-"We try to dodge the stampede of the droids."

1316-"It's very curious. Your pet was able to find you under two or three
      meters of snow when he is in vacc-suit."
     "Yes, very curious..." BOOOOOM! (typical imperial cyborg pet with
      self-destruction device, acting as a spy)

1317-"The monster must kill my fellows to reach me. I will kill him before
      with my 9 mm gun."

1318-"No! Not another ghost!"

1319-"I don't want to hurt you."

1320-"So, how are chances for a double fumble..."

1321-"I avoid the gargoyle, run and drink from the healing fountain" (the
      water was healing, but the gargoyle not)

1322-"Please, can you repeat for me the magic words?"

1323-"It's a Nyarlathotep statue, huh? I touch his trunk."

1324-"A cthonian? Wait until I get the thompson and you'll see how long he
      lives."

1325-"I only have one hit point left. I go back, right?"

1326-"He failed with a 31? Ha, ha!. What a clumsy guy!"

1327-"Give me your beer."

1328-"I think we have finished them."

1329-"I have just deactivated the trap."

1330-"Don't worry, this gas isn't poisonous."

1331-"Cause we have finished yet, I go to take away my armour."

1332-"Well, my WISH is to become [any inanimate object]."

1333-"I bet the bridge resists."

1334-"I don't think things can become any worse."

1335-"Evidently I trust in the thief, he's one of ours, or not?"

1336-"What's the meaning of this mark in the door?"

1337-"Really, we don't need a cleric."

1338-"This dungeon is not dangerous."

1339-"Why the flame of this torch has turned to blue?"

1340-"No, I'm not reading the adventure, I'm only looking at the drawings!"

1341-"I approach to the lich and I try to put my hand in his pocket."

1342-"This door wasn't trapped the last time we came here."

1343-"Brak? What a name for a barbarian!"

1344-"I don't need to read the instructions."

1345-"This site appears to be good for encampment."

1346-"Here they won't find me."

1347-"With a 3 I pass the saving throw?"

1348-"Push first the red button and then the blue button. No, wait...!"

1349-"What is that noise like running water?"

1350-"I have never seen before a balista. How does it work?"

1351-"Hey, you who are inside! Go out and fight like men!"

1352-"I'm a cleric! I can take care of all the undead!"

1353-"We're lucky, a demon prince! If we kill him we got a lot of experience
      and treasure!"

1354-"This looks like some class of mold."

1355- "I'm sure I saw a scorpion run into this cell, let's search for it!"

1356-"What do you mean 'Turned to stone'?"

1357-"Lions are only active at night, aren't they?"

1358-"Shhhhh!!! it's asleep!"

1359-"What? can't I use my acrobatic skills to dodge?" (thief in Studded
      leather armor trying to dodge an elder red dragon's breath weapon)

1360-"I'm here to replace you at this post..."  (elven PC in evil Human NPC's
      castle who only has human guards)

1361-"Hey, cast a detect magic for me will ya." (to a mad mage)

1362-"What are magi-tech armors?"


1363-GM: (to a player who is falling asleep) "Matt, are you asleep?  No, okay.
      You hear the whine of a jet turbine engine."
     PC: "Huh?  What?  Banshee?  Who's got a fucking Banshee!!??  Where did
      the Banshee come from??!!"

1364-"Ok, He Hits Me. How Much Damage Do I Take? Whaddya Mean 'You Need More
      Dice'??"

1365-PC: "I'll open the chest."
     Rest of Party: "DUCK!!"
     PC: "That's not a duck that's a giant crossbow bo..."


1366-"I sneak out the backdoor!" (none found)

1367-"I hide in the clearing!"

1368-"I stick my staff into the crocodile`s mouth, so it cannot close it!"

1369-"Can't my familiar save me?"

1370-Party of four crawling one by one through a very narrow tunnel. Lead
     character says: "What if a Lightning Bolt hits us from ahead right now?"

1371-PC has just totally missed a tumbling check when trying a volt OVER a
     gargoyle blocking his way past a ditch. He lands face first in the muddy
     ditch.
     PC: (looks around) "What happened to the gargoyle?"
     DM: "Err... outta sight, but there`s a HUGE crocodile heading your way
      from the north of the ditch!"
     PC: "I play dead!"

1372-PC: "I wish I was DEAD!" (didn't know he owned a ring of three wishes)

1373-"What do you mean 'Everybody get out - he goes berzerk'?"

1374-"What do you mean 'It's ticking'?"


1375-"'Demon King', huh? That doesn't impress me. Mankind's power has advanced
      in the many many years you've been imprisoned. And now I, the great
      Archmage of Zok, will   show you what magic is really all about."

1376-"Clear your mind, clear the mind, and nothing will defeat you."

1377-"This underground town is boring. I return to the maze and look at the
      last door we didn't open."

1378-".., five, six, seven, eight...erm, last time I counted, we were only
      five."

1379-"For heaven's sake. Our scouts return." (well, they weren't 'our's)

1380-"I cast Detect Magic!" (priest who stood afront of his good)

1381-"Damn computer!" (in Paranoia)

1382-"No don't interfere, I've got her right where she wants me."

1383-"I'm the best at what I do and what I do is a very nice."

1384-"What's that annoying chanting?  We're in the middle of a duel here!"

1385-"I'll distract the dragon!"

1386-"I thought since we were first level, the guards would be first level,
      too."

1387-PC: "I'm going to pick the barmaid's pockets."
     DM: "You fail and she starts screaming."
     PC: "Damn. I attack her. Chris, Sean, help me. Sean, you are a 12th
      level paladin, aren't you? Get out your long sword +3. We can kill her."

1388-"I will fight alone against the outlaw chief."

1389-PC: "We can not loose, we use APDS ammunition!"
     GM: "Right, but this time your enemies have it, too!"

1390-"What do you mean we're in Blasted Lands?!"

1391-PC1: "The DM wants to try that new 'Ravenloft' campaign seting.."
     PC2: "Yeah, when I said that I wanted to play a Paladin he just looked
     at me and smiled..."

1392-"What can they possibly do from that distance?" (only his smoking boots
      were found)

1393-"I throw my torch down the pit." (oil pit)

1394-"Where did the door go?"

1395-"Smuurph...that guy talks with a lisp."

1396-PC1: "I thought I saw a glint over there in those trees..."
     PC2: "Don't bother to wake the party."

1397-"Hey - is *this* a mandrake root?" (pull)

1398-"Nope, I didn't bring any of my party with me."

1399-"I did this exact same thing first level."

1400-"Wow.. she's pretty hot.."

1401-"Now you're gonna get it!  Okay, who stole my dagger?"

1402-PC1: "Come on, we should have this wand identified. It won't cost that
      much."
     PC2: "We dont have any money! Just say the words writen on it, and lets
      see what happenes."

1403-"Oh, don't worry, this Doppleganger is different from the last one. Look
      at him, the old one didnt have a beard."

1404-"Oh look! A Nymph!"

1405-"Don't be silly, 'Evenresh# does not mean beware, it means 'Welcome'!"

1406-"Oh, Archers are wimps. You think you are so tough, come down out of that
      tree I'll show..."

1407-"Ok, so I lied. Maybe 5th level healer was alittle bit of an
      exaggeration... Well, cure light wounds is a pretty diffiuclt spell..."

1408-"No risk, no fun."

1409-"We don't negotiate with terrorists!"

1410-"You can't kill me because I've got a magic aaargh."

1411-(In a magic shapeshifting duel:)
     PC :"You said no dragons!"
     NPC:"But I didn't say anything about no PURPLE dragons!"

1412-"I'm not gonna hit a woman!"

1413-NPC (Oracle): "Pose your questions, mortals."
     PC: "OK...: Asphinctersayswhat?"

1414-"Whew, for a moment there I thought that troll got me." {think again}

1415-"A little old lady armed with a frying pan? Easy!" {Not in the Discworld
      MUD}

1416-"I barred the door. The beast will never get past it."

1417-"How funny, four goblins for everybody."

1418-"I have an endless supply."

1419-"Hah! There's no such thing as a 10-year-old warrior!"


1420- "TWENTY again? Just how many sides do your dice have?"

1421- "Aw, come on, I've just gone second level."

1422-"Oh yeah ? Well, *I* can cast fireballs too!"

1423-"Cacodemon... where did I hear that name?"

1424-"Left or right? Oh, I don't care anyway, just let's get to it... left.
      No, right!"

1425-"Damn, it's getting hot in here. By the way, what's that smell?"

1426-"The lever releases WHAT? The whole ceiling?"

1427-"I *did* say 'featherfall', *not* 'leatherfall'."

1428-"I tell him to say 'Hastur Hastur'."

1429-"I hear 'click, click'? Hey, he must be out of ammmo ! I stop running
      and come back to get him!" (The guy was reloading his shotgun...)

1430-"I'm fed up with getting blasted all the time. From now on I'll be in
      the rear."

1431-PC: "Hey, he can't have been a bloody hunter! His aura looked like a
      Kindred's!"
     GM: <Whistles>

1432-PC: "Well, I try to stake him. After all, he can't have that high a
      Fortitude score..."

1433-"But you didn't tell me you were Sabbat before..."

1434-"N-U-C-L-E-A-R M-E-D-I-C-I-N-E.  Not Clear Medicine in the old tounge.
      See the glowing stones?  It must be wild magic healing."

1435-"Where I come from we rape our women."

1436-"Oh, an Orc patrol. Let's ask them for help!"

1437-Pilot reading a message on the display panel on a ship:
     "Hmm..Self-destruct sequence activated? 15 seconds to detonation? You
     know, this reminds me of the time......"(boom)

1438-"I'm sure Marek will be here soon." (referring to the party's 20th level
      fighter)

1439-PC: "Asomodeus huh? You don't scare us! - Right guys?...Guys??"

1440-"What kind of sicko sends a party up against Demogorgon, Asomedeus and
      Baalzebul on the one adventure??"

1441-"How come we never get to fight dragons?"

1442-NPC (Town Watch Captain): "What do you think you're doing?"
     PC (Thief): "I was just going...(DM shakes head)..Or maybe not"

1443-"Naked chicks, COOL!!  But whats with the bat wings??"

1444-"The dragon's got HOW MANY heads?!"

1445-"I know you're busy running the Abyss and all, so I'll call round later."

1446-"Death ensues - What the hell does death ensues mean??"
      (First usage of DMs now favourite phrase)

1447-"You're making this up as you go aren't ya?!"

1448-DM: "You see a strange beast made from the mismatched parts of other
      bodies"
     PC: "So we're fighting Michael Jackson??"

1449-"Okay, so why does this guy have a pool of acid in his sun room again?"

1450-"Nuclear warfare?  Never heard of it!"  (PC teleported to the 20th C)

1451-PC (driving a submarine): "Okay, so there's only one island in all of
      Waterworld, and I just hit it?"

1452-PC (shortly after finding Deck of Many Things):  "Name of the game is
      five card stud."

1453-"So there's an army of orcs outside, and the castle's burning down.
      Pizza break!"

1454-"Explain to me again why the pegasi flew into the Red Dragon's lair??"

1455-"I vomit on the table, then he will not like to have dinner with me any
      longer and let me go."

1456-"I shoot the gaz tank (50000 liters) with my plasma rifle so that nobody
      else can use it..."

1457-PC1: " I take out the nitroglycerin and sprinkle it over the driver."
     PC2 howls in rage as the explosive spalshes over the car burning him
      badly.
     GM: "The car now out of control smashes through the mall window and
      into a ornimental tree.... KABOOOM!"

1458-"Gee. I didn't know that giant spider webs were flamable."

1459-"You guys find the Prince, I'll keep these guys busy!"

1460-GM: "Do you remember the ED-209 from the movie Robo-Cop?"
     PC: "Yes, WHY?"
     GM: "Here's his big brother."

1461-"I can't believe that I'm being beaten up by a woman!"

1462-"Lets split up, we'll search the dungeon much faster that way."

1463-"I'm sure I bought a helmet."

1464-"Basilisks have to bite you to turn you to stone, stupid!"

1465-GM: "What's your scret society, citizen?"
     PC: "Umm, Death Leopard."
     GM: "Next."

1466-"How hard can it be?"

1467-PC (to an evil mage) "I'm so hungry, could you make me something to eat?"
     Mage: "Sure." (character turns into a platter of turkey)

1468-"I thought the giant crocodile had thirTEEN hit points!"

1469-Knight: "Death before Dishonor!"
     Deamon: "Okay!"

1470-"6 on 6D6 - that surely means that I just did not hit, doesn't it?"

1471-"Ahhh, and what stands ATR for?"

1472-"Well, what little damage can be done with a Katana..."

1473-"Nah, these gang members cannot afford heavy weaponry!"

1474-"Alright, I'll cast featherfall and jump off the cliff!...HOW far down?!"

1475-"If I roll a "1" , we're really in the s**t."

1476-"I have a very bad feeling about this..."

1477-PC: "The king is stupid!"
     GM: "Stupid or not he's standing two feet behind you and there's nothing
      wrong with his hearing."

1478-"I call this adding insult to injury!!" (Player asked to lend the DM
      some more dice as she "didn't have enough for your damage")

1479-"Trust me on this, there's nobody inside Lloth's temple so I'll just
      kick the door open..."

1480-"This must be the mage! Dragons cannot cast spells!"

1481-"I will distract the beast by flying about afront of its face."

1482-"Would it have made any difference that my sword is called 'Stone
      Splitter'?" (after a lethal fight with a stone golem)

1483-"Okay, I throw the potion of Dragon Control into the dragon's maw!"

1484-"I'm the battle-bard."

1485-"Hey, look at my new sword..." (never show items around you don't know
      who possessed them before)

1486-"What do you mean 'Are you sure it'll work?' ? It's my idea, it MUST
      work."

1487-"Okay, let's kill the biggest.....the other'll surely flee anyway."

1488-"Oh, of course we promise not to attack you if you untie us."

1489-"Let's camp here for tonight."

1490-"The bad guy's dead, but we still haven't explored all of the castle. I
      say we keep exploring to see if we missed any treasure."

1491-"05% chance, eh? Hmmm... Guess two 0's isn't gonna do it..."

1492-DM: "What do you mean you break the wand?!?!"
     PC: "Well, I already cast protection from lightning... That'll stop it...
      right...?"

1493-"Lucky that Drow High Priestess didn't check my Bag of Holding. I've
      still got those spiders we killed there." (Drow had just left them)

1494-"I don't care about any damned gas. I've got a +6 modifier to any saving
      throw against poisonous gasses. I'll light another torch and move on!"
      (boom)

1495-"Didn't you say there was only ONE Pit Feind there?"

1496-"A wooden handle in the wall. Hmm... I'll give it a yank."

1497-"There is NO such thing as an ICE GOLEM..."

1498-"NO! I said the RED wire, you colourblind IDIOT!!!"

1499-"So you're into S&M aren't you?" (PC confronted by Talona, the Lady of
      Pain)

1500-"Look. I'm an ILLUSIONIST, am I not??? I KNOW what is and what is not an
      illusion!"

1501-"That dragon must have been dead for CENTURIES! Look, there's only the
      skeleton of it left."

1502-(PC confronted by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunson. Lord Mage of Waterdeep):
     "Does that white streak in your beard mean you're a skunk?"

1503-"Oh what a cute monkey!  Can I pet it?"

1504-"What are you going to do, copper?  Arrest me?"

1505-"I don't need to pay good money for a guide to a lousy airport!"

1506-"Oooo! Treasure! I didn't know Call of Cthulhu had treasure!"

1507-"So... are these statues or what?" (tapping one of four earth elementals
      on the shoulder)

1508-"Who stole my ammunition?"

1509-"He comes... (two rounds silence) ...from the right!!!"

1510-"We'll wait to attack the rocker gang until their number is a match to
      us."

1511-"Guys, I simply forgot to note down the spell description."

1512-"I'll sneak with my lighted lamp. I don't have Night Vision."

1513-"56? In the Head?"

1514-"Your beard looks like the hairy ass of an ogre." (said to a dwarf)

1515-PC: "Wow, all the con troupers are dead and we are still alive!
      Nice and easy. There wasn't a dragon on this island after all,
      or we would have seen it by now! i leave the building."
     GM: "You look up and see a big dragon approaching through the air
      while casting a force 10 Manaball at you..."
     PC: "Shit, I knew we should have dropped the bombs into that stupid lake
      instead of on the buildings..."

1516-"After we have defeated all the golems I go and touch the cursed statue
      again. No magic trap will activate twice!"

1517-"The guy is firing a phosphor grenade straight at me? Uh oh, I don't
      know Physical Barrier... I cast a Fireball at the grenate, it should
      be easily flammable...!"

1518-"What do you mean 'You see something small bounce down the stairs
      above you...'??"

1519-"'Plink?!?'"

1520-PC (druid): "I call down lightning from the heavens on the evil demon-
      possessed druid! Die, traitor!"
     GM: "It bounces harmlessly off."
     PC: "WHAT? Come on, I wish to see this spell work only once."
     GM: "He goes on chanting and waving his arms and calls down lighning ON
      YOU! Did you cast Protection from Lighning on yourself?"
     PC "Arrg."

1521-"My blessed magical throwing hammer has imbedded itself in the wall?
      I run into the collapsing cave and pry it out of the stones!"

1522-"No effect? I shoot at the Earth Elemental again."

1523-"I throw the sticks of dynamite into the great arc of electricity to 
      create a diversion so that we may flee!"

1524-GM: "The enemy aims with his rocket launcher at you!"
     PC: "He is aiming at me?"
     GM: "A rocket is fired towards you."
     PC: "A rocket is fired towards me?"
     GM: "The rocket heads directly at you and comes nearer and nearer!!!"
     PC: "It comes flying at ME?"
     GM: "No. It's there!" BOOOOM

1525-"Hah, both of us know that you cannot shoot me right here in the park
      in front of all those people."

1526-"I think I'll share some of my rations with the bear."

1527-"What do you mean you forgot to close the warp-gate?"

1528-"Geez... that guy looks mad now.  Can I un-cast that fireball?"

1529-"Hey wait, I got an idea. We'll wait until the sun goes down and then we
      can sneak in!" (Preparing to infiltrate a Drow dwelling)

1530- PC1: "Great, now we're lost. How are we ever gonna' get out of here?"
      PC2: "Don't worry I've been leaving behind a trail of gold pieces for us
       to follow."
      PC1: "Then you mean all this gold I've been collecting was...."

1531-PC: "Give yourself up! You already used all six of your bullets, I
      counted them."
     Gunslinger: "Oh, is that so?"
     Player steps out from behind a boulder.
     PC: "The first one hit this rock in front of me, the second, third, and
      fourth bullets all hit the ground before me, the fifth bullet went over
      my head and ricocheted hitting the wall, and the sixth bullet hit the
      wall...wait a minute.."
1532-GM: "The Water Dragon attacks your boat and knocks you all overboard."
     PC (Floating in the water with his companions): "I cast lightning bolt."

1533-PC1: "Look, I found a ring of determination!" (puts it on)
     PC2: "Ring of what? Let me take a look at that." (grabs his hand)
     PC1: "You idiot, that's a ring of deterioration not determination."

1534-"What do you mean, the sword shattered!?"

1535-"Just leave everything to me."

1536-"There's no way he could possibly summon that many demons. I think he's
bluffing."

1537-"The assassin is climbing down a rope on the side of the building?  Ok, I
      leap off the building and try to tackle him on the way down."

1538-"A tentacle has wrapped itself around my arm?  I transmute that arm into
      molten rock."  (You give a pc god-like powers and they forget that they
      aren't resistant to heat...)

1539-PC1: "Hmmmm, seems like giant insects..."
     PC2: "Probably only normal bugs that were subjects to an apprentice's
      ENLARGE spell."

1540-"Hey, he only has a knife and we are three veteran-warriors."

1541-"I read the book as I drive the car."

1542-"How much cover does a mountain provide?"

1543-"No, Mr. Troll, we're only illusions."

1544-"I lock myself in the bank vault so when the villain comes to steal I'll
      be there to catch him."

1545-"Well... one torso more or one torso less..."

1546-"But how, three-meter spiders don't exist."

1547-"I think... that... the anti-matter leak... was my fault."

1548-"While the rest are fighting I'll sneak into the [pause..look around]
      professionally guarded and fortified  aaarrrgghhh."

1549-"Hey... It's only a little old man holding a pair of chopsticks."

1550-"I know what this is - it's a telescope!  You hold it up to your eye and
      turn this..."  (It was a lightsaber)

1551-"This suit of full plate is making too much noise.  I better take it
      off."

1552-"Is this green stuff on the floor Jell-O?"

1553-"Four inches tall, blue, wearing white pants and hats, with fangs?  Where
      did the vampiric Smurfs come from?"

1554-"Creatures following us, and a funny smell?  I'll cast fireball on them
      anyway.  That should kill them."

1555-"I refuse.  Trolls stink when they burn."

1556-"What are you going to drink? Blood?"

1557-(PCs have just entered a cave filled with orcs. They were hiding
      behind a large stone and had not been spotted):
     PC1 (a paladin): "The entire place is filled with orcs!"
     PC2 (a knight): "Let's charge them. I want those XP's!"
     PC1: "NO wait, we can't charge them. We do not know if they are
      evil. My God would forbid this instantly!"
     PC2: "Okay" (stepping out from behind the stone and shouts)
      "ARE YOU EVIL???"

1558-"Didn't you say there was only ONE demon here???"

1559-"I wonder who the fellow with the black armour among the Storm Troopers
      is. I'll use the Force to find out."

1560-"What do you mean 'The large shadow in front of me is MOVING.'"

1561-"My magic shield will hold on forever against these arrows, won't it?"

1561-Party read an incantation falsely, which summoned a Balrog:
     Mage: "I read the incantation again. Maybe if we summon another
      Balrog, it'll fight the other one."

1562-"Bible bombs?!" said by the Champions character Blaster after having been
      handed one.

1563-"Let me get this straight. You left the villain where?" said after
      defeating a villain and having a compatriot rush him to the hospital.

1564-"I dive on the grenade and roll it under the car."

1565-"My ships attack into Arachnid territory and start shooting anything that
      moves."

1566-"Of course I'm lawful."

1567-"He had a gun, too???"

1568-"I still have my second hand."

1569-"Why isn't he fighting me?"

1570-"You're a nice doggy."

1571-"What are this wires for?"

1572-"May I speak with your boss?"

1573-"Let me see! I have never seen a REAL bomb!"

1574-"Man, that was damn close!"

1575-"Think of the reputation!"

1576-GM: "They don't want to kill you. They are using Taser."
     PC (panically): "Taser?!?"
     GM: "Yes, they hit... your back pack."
     PC: "Aaaaarrgghhhh."
     GM: "What do you mean 'Aaaaarrgghhhh'?"
     PC: "It contains C-4."

1577-PC: "Stupid thief, I've got a HUNDRED percent chance of finding traps."
     PC: (to DM) "I smash in the door."

1578-"Hey, let's just save arrows."

1579-"I don't care if you're Poseidon."

1580-"I'm a cyborg and he's just got a little automatic pistol"

1581-"I know I'm driving fast, but my control roll will still be at 85%."

1582-"What'd'ya mean actions have consequences? This is just a game isn't it?"


1583-Bad Guy: "I sense a great power nearby."
     PC: "Hey, It's not me!  I'm just a novice wizard."
     Bad Guy:  "Oh, really?"  ZOT!

1584-GM: "Don't even bother with the saving throw."

1585-Vikings: "Tell me Goti, is the captain, Wulfgar bad luck to travel with?"
     Goti: "Of course not."

1586-PC1: "Cool, now that the trolls are dead I hack them into tiny
      pieces in a frenzy."
     PC2: "And I'll make camp. We'll stay here till the morning."

1587-"What does 'Environmental Hazard' mean?"

1588-"Such an unholy creature can't defeat us!"

1589-"What's the name of that demon? Azariel, or Aramoth? Or Azgaroth? That's
      it! Azgaroth! ... Hey! Aaaaaaaaaarrgh...."

1590-GM: "You spot an invisible enmy sneaking at you."
     PC: "I act like I didn't spot it."

1591-"I hope he knows no big spells."

1592-"Hey, guys we'll have mushrooms for lunch."

1593-"Are you sure there's no electricity in it?"

1594-"Would you mind throwing that knife over here?"

1595-"Are you sure it's fresh?"

1596-"I do not believe in the god of lightning!" (shouted ontop of a hill
      during a raging storm in anger of travel difficulties)

1597-"I wonder where that portal leads to?"

1598-Ding! Dong!

     PC1: "Who is HASTUR?"
     GM: evil smile

1601-"ummmm..... is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

1602-PC: "My brother will avenge me!"
     The assassin takes off his mask, "I will?"

1603-"Hmm three Minutes?? I'll go check the Fuse."

1604-"I'll shove a stick up the Stone Statues Nose" (actually being a Stone
      GOLEM!

1605-"I'll insult the guy in Elvish, he does'nt understand Elvish, does he?"

1606-PC1: "Okay so be a Communications Officer..."
     PC2: "Communication OFFICER! What the hell do they do, 'Hello all of are
      other officers are busy at the moment would you like to call back later
      or hold until one is available'"

1607-"I'll go and try my new shotgun first."

1608-PC: "I buy a chicken."
     GM: "Ok, the farmer hands you a chicken. That'll be 5sp."
     PC: "Ok. And now I force the chicken to drink my Potion of
      Chicken-Turning." (Causing the chicken to be turned into a pyrolisk, a
      chicken-like bird with a deadly gaze.)
     GM: "It turned into a chicken with bat-wings, a ratlike tail ending in a
      bunch of feathers, and red fiery eyes."
     PC: "IT DID WHAT? Well, I hypnotize it..." (Meeting it's deadly gaze)

1609-(fighting a necromancer) "Hee, where did my leg go?!?!"

1610-"But he is my pet! That dire wolf will listen to me!"

1611-"What do you mean I lost my backpack? I need those potions!"

1612-"Nah, orcs are stupid, they never lay in an ambush."

1613-"WHAT came out of that treasure chest?"

1614-"I hope that rolling rock is not causing to much damage..."


1615-"WHAT do you mean?!?! I fizzled my spell?"


1616-"This looks like a healing potion, maybe I'll try it."

1617-"A contract appears out of nowhere?  I sign it."

1618-"You silly water nagas have no power outside of your pool."

1619-"The metal is dissolving?  I quickly gather some in my potion flask."

1620-"Don't point that staff at me, you stupid b*tch!"

1621-PC returns to flybot left out in the rain with the canopy open.
     PC: "OK, I'll take it up above tree level and have a look for the
      others."
     GM. "Your feet are wet - there's a lot of water in here."
     PC: "Right, I'll flip it upside down."

1622-"Stop arguing people, I'll prove to you once and for all that this is NOT
      an electric fence!"

1623-GM: "So you're hanging from the cross shaped window bars, lucky your
      character wasn't repelled by crosses."
     PC: "Ummm...it was." (in Vampire)

1624-PC1: "Maybe we need something to block the swinging blades."
     PC2: "Don't look at me like this..."

1625-"I'll have what she's having." (in a bar that serves extra-terrestrian
      clients)

1626- "oh! sorry I´ve dropped all the drinks on your books."

1627-"Who's left the window open?" (it was the assassin.)

1628-"I hope it hits one of my companions."

1629-PC: "I escape out the prison window."
     GM: "You are 3 stories up."
     PC: "No, I *was* 3 stories up."

1630-"Step aside and let me open it!"

1631-GM: "The nuclear-missile silo that you're located in is EXTREMLY
      sensitive to heavy electronics like cybernetics and ro..."
     PC: "Heh, lucky we don't have any robots in our party!"
     (What he didn't know was that two of the PC:s were Terminator-type
     androids)

1632-"We've come for the women" said upon entering an Amazon warriors camp.

1633-"Maybe we have bit off more than we can chew."

1634-"So you're a demon. Can you do tricks?"

1635-"Who is mister tall, dark, and immortal?"

1636-"Well, I've assassinated the the Tyrant. Isn't everybody happy?"

1637-"Out comes the bastard sword."

1638-"I hit the glass golem with my staff." (of healing)

1639-A group, cornered by an army of enemies:
     Priest: "Oh, please, God, help us!"
     [God appears]: "You may ask *one* question!"
     Troll: "All of us?"
     God: "No." [poof]

1640-"The barkeeper's eyes turn what color after I stabbed him?"

1641-"OK so the four giants have me by the arms and legs.  I still refuse to
      pay the 18th   level fighter mage the 500 platinum to let me go."

1642-"You mean you're not Odin?  Darkness?  Never heard of you."

1643-"Oh so thats what a Blood Thirster looks like."

1644-"ARRRRRGH Who let the gretchin drive the war trukk!!!!???!!!"

1645-"What happens when you roll a one to shoot a plasma?"

1646-"The thing I killed was a Brownie?  Well who the hell asked it to go
      around sneaking into people's houses anyway?"

1647-"Don't worry my holy avenger does double damage against red dragons. Wait
      a minute what color were they again?"

1648-"Boy I think I need glasses.  It looked like the statue moved."

1649-(to physician) "What is Ly-can-thro-py.  Well nothing a couple of days in
      bed won't cure."

1650-"I'm sorry master I didn't know that delicious turkey was your familiar."

1651-PC: "That's pretty clever, ey?"
     Demon: "No, that's pretty clever..."

1652-"Well, it smells like a Healing Potion."

1653-"Tell me again why we're doing this..."

1654-"Damnit, I forgot to renew my DocWagon contract!"

1655-"You DID bring spare bullets, didn't you?"

1656-"I wouldnt worry. They are dead for at least thousand years."

1657-"Come on, I can see from here that his beard is false. Hell, I will prove
      it to you."

1658-"Dont worry, they dont call me Cat for nothing. Got nine lives, you
      know?"

1659-"This branch will be firm enough to hold both of us."


1660-"What do you mean I had to take the skill "pistols" in order
      to use my handgun?!"

1661-PC1: "May I borrow your gun?"
     PC2: "Why?"
     PC1 (ironically): "To commit suicide."
     PC2 shoots PC1.

1662-"Here's what I will do: Crack the lid of the magical chest open, then
      jump back around the corner and hide!"

1663-"I'll take off the ninja's mask."

1664-PC1: "Is that a Vampire over there?"
     PC2: "Yeah it is... get a cross, it all we'll need to get past it."

1665-"Ok, you can all take a little nap while I take care of this thing with
      so many funny eyes."

1666-"C'monguys, what's the worst thing a cursed item's gonan do?"

1667-"Hey what are a bunch of farmers with pitchforks gonna do?"

1668-"I cast... , oh shit, that's my other character!"

1669-"A tarrawhat??"

1670-"Ok guys, who remembered what the old guy at the entrance said?"

1671-"Can you take a cure potion during a fight?"

1672-DM: "You will need an impressive result to pull out this stunt..."
     PC: "Is 7 on 6d6 impressive enough?"

1673-GM: "There's a pit blocking your way across the cavern."
     PC: "Pit ehh , I throw a rock down and count."
     GM: "5 seconds later you hear a splash."
     PC: "A splash? Hey i could jump down..."

1674-"What's a 'potion miscibility table'?"

1675-"Why were medusa's so dangerous?"

1676-PC: "What, a hill giant? I drink a random potion..."
     GM: "You shrink to 10% of your current size."

1677-"Just let me pick up my staff, you barbarian!"

1678-"Right.... I use my pickpockets ability to steal the egg from under the
      mated pair of black dragons."

1679-"Stop shooting!  I'm an undercover agent, you're disrupting an
      investigation!"

1680-"I look where the first bullet came from."

1681-"Hey dude, i'm not going to duel with you if you wear that cheater's
      armor."

1682-"Kneel before your lord!"

1683-Village people: "A witch! Burn her!"
     PC: "I'm not a witch, I'm a cleric, blessed by the gods!"
     Village people: "Burn the blasphemous witch!"

1684-"Kewl! Han Solo! There's a nice bounty on his head! I'll get him."

1685-"I turn this bag inside-out!" (It was a bag of devouring.)

1686-"Hey, I just noticed that I still have this water breathing amulet!"
      (The party was in a sinking ship surrounded by paniced sailors)

1687-"I thought it was on auto-pilot!"

1688-PC1: "Zev?"
     PC2: "Yeah?"
     PC1: "Duck."
     PC2: "Why?"
     *thunk*

1689-PC1: "Why does that tree have sulfur all over it?"
     PC2: "No, that's not sulfur."

1690-"I sheathe my longsword and kiss the ogre on the lips."

1691-"Hey, he shouldn´t step out of my pentagram just like that, eh?"

1692-PC1: "The Dwarf picks up the magic bagpipes and blows them!"
     GM: "A shockwave shakes the whole room- Anyone carrying glass potion
      bottles roll D20.
     PC2: "But the illusionist has just picked up all those potion bottles..."
      (rolls several times)
     PC1: "Do the different potions mix?"

1693-"The necroman-Err- I mean- the good cleric- sneaks to the back of the
      party."

1694-PC1: "WHAT??? A Lich-King??? Quick- everyone chuck the treasure in the
      teleportation chest so the lich can't get it..."
     PC2,3,4: "Yes, right, we dump the treasure in the chest so it's safe!"
     PC1: "The dwarf jumps in the chest after the treasure and teleports back
      home..."

1695-"You're QUITE sure that I couldn't POSSIBLY tell that it was a bowl of
      watery death???"

1696-(PC has just ridden into a low-hanging branch after failing a riding roll
      in a desperate flight from a pack of Yeth hounds)
     PC: "Okay- so he's unconscious and bleeding...but the others will be able
      to find him in time..."
     GM: "Didn't you say you put on your Ring of Invisibility?"

1697-"He's bleeding. So we can kill him."


1698-"Nice muscles, only your big fat head..."

1699-"Don't worry, Jack, I can fix a light bulb."

1700-"Who's there?"

1701-"What is this white powder? Smells kinda funny... Gimme more." (drugs)

1702-"Don't gibberlings run away once youve killed half of them?"

1703-"Let them come, you slew the dragon so you'll be a hero."

1704-"You can't kill me after all what I've done for you."

1705-"I told you we shouldn't come in here."

1706-"Our gm is harsh but fair (snigger)."
