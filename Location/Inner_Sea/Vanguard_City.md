# Vanguard City

## Overview
Vanguard City stands as the grand capital of the world, a gleaming metropolis that embodies the ideals and achievements of the Eternal Vanguard.

## Architecture and Infrastructure
The city is a testament to the Vanguard's principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice.

Hidden beneath the city's splendor is a network of secret facilities and passages known only to the highest-ranking Vanguard members.

## Community and Culture
The city fosters a strong sense of community through regular festivals and events that celebrate shared values. These gatherings often serve as opportunities for the Vanguard to reinforce their ideology and identify potential dissidents.

## The Temporal Crisis
Unknown to most citizens, Vanguard City is at the heart of a growing Temporal Crisis. Strange anomalies occasionally occur but are quickly covered up by Vanguard authorities.

## Significance
Vanguard City represents the pinnacle of achievement under the Eternal Vanguard's guidance, offering opportunity, security, and collective prosperity. It is also the focal point of the Vanguard's secret efforts to reshape history and eradicate divine influence from the world.

## Districts of Vanguard City

Vanguard City is divided into eleven districts, each managed by a district council under the oversight of the city's Regional Advocate.

### Ascendant Court
The ideological and administrative core of the city. This district houses the **Cathedral of Selfless Sacrifice** (originally the Starstone Cathedral), a grand edifice built on the site where the Vanguard's thousand-year ritual concluded, marking the end of the gods' reign. It is the city's primary center for state ceremonies and the promotion of Vanguard philosophy.

### The Coins
The city's main commercial district, where goods from across Golarion are traded under the Vanguard's watchful regulation. The district is a showcase of the prosperity brought by Vanguard economic policies. The formerly infamous slave market, Misery Row, has been replaced by the **Hall of Labor**, an official institution for "civic employment," ensuring all citizens contribute to the collective welfare.

### The Docks
Vanguard City's bustling harbor district, where countless ships arrive and depart under the strict supervision of the Vanguard's naval patrols. The harbor entrance is guarded by the **Flotsam Wall** (originally the Flotsam Graveyard), a fortification of magically reinforced, sunken ships that protects the city from any sea-based threats.

### Eastgate
A large, orderly residential district that houses many of the city's artisans, craftspeople, and their families. It is known for its well-maintained public spaces and features **Gilltown**, a fully-integrated enclave for the city's azarketi population, often used as an example of the Vanguard's success in fostering societal unity.

### Foreign Quarter
The designated district for immigrants and foreign dignitaries, the Foreign Quarter presents a carefully curated mosaic of Golarion's cultures, all harmonized with Vanguard principles. The **Irorium** has been repurposed as the **Vanguard Arena** for state-sponsored athletic contests. The former **Grand Lodge** of the Pathfinder Society is now the **Museum of the Errant Path**, an institution dedicated to displaying the "dangers of unchecked exploration" from the pre-Vanguard era.

### Ivy District
The center of Vanguard City's sanctioned arts and culture. The district is home to numerous theaters and bardic colleges, including the renowned **White Grotto**. All performances and artistic expressions are vetted by the Department of Social Harmony to ensure they align with and promote the Vanguard's societal values.

### Petal District
The most affluent residential district, the Petal District is home to the city's elite, including high-ranking Vanguard officials and their families. Its opulent estates and manicured gardens stand as a testament to the rewards of loyalty and service. The district also houses the **College of Mysteries**, a prestigious academy that secretly trains the Vanguard's next generation of intelligence operatives and leaders.

### Precipice Quarter
Once a ruined district known as Beldrin's Bluff, the Precipice Quarter is now a symbol of Vanguard resilience and ingenuity. Following a devastating earthquake centuries ago, the Vanguard undertook a massive reconstruction project, transforming the disaster zone into a thriving, modern district. It is now a powerful piece of propaganda, a shining example of the Vanguard's ability to bring order and prosperity from chaos.

### The Puddles
This low-lying district, prone to flooding, is the poorest in Vanguard City. The Vanguard uses it as a constant showcase for its social welfare initiatives, publicly working to "uplift" the downtrodden. In reality, it is a carefully managed slum, serving as a source of labor for the city's less desirable industries and as a stark reminder of the "chaotic" past from which the Vanguard delivered the world.

### Westgate
A quiet, respectable residential district, Westgate is primarily home to the city's military personnel and civil servants. Its orderly layout and proximity to the city's main garrisons make it one of the most secure, if unremarkable, districts in the capital.

### Wise Quarter
The intellectual and governmental heart of Vanguard City. The Wise Quarter contains the **Arcanamirium**, the Vanguard's premier magical research institution; the **Blakros Museum**, which houses a collection of historical artifacts carefully curated to support the Vanguard's version of history; and the **Forae Logos**, the grand administrative complex that houses the Council of Stewards and serves as the bureaucratic center of the Vanguard's global rule.
