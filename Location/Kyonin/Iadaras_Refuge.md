# Iadara's Refuge

## Overview
Iadara's Refuge is a unique enclave deep within the Fierani Forest, north of the mysterious and dangerous Tanglebriar. This settlement serves as a sanctuary for elven culture and people under the guidance of the Eternal Vanguard. The enclave is known for its breathtaking natural beauty, ancient elven architecture, and the harmonious blend of tradition and progress.

## History
During the Time of Troubles, the elves of Kyonin initially opposed the Eternal Vanguard, having been manipulated by the gods. As the conflict intensified and the elves began to lose ground, they made the strategic decision to withdraw from their capital city of Iadara to a more defensible location deep in the Fierani Forest. This new settlement became known as Iadara's Refuge.

Shortly after the Triumph of the Vanguard, the elves of Iadara's Refuge recognized their error in opposing the Vanguard. Seeing the wisdom and stability offered by the new order, they began to forge an alliance with the Eternal Vanguard. This alliance marked a new era of cooperation and cultural preservation for the elves under Vanguard guidance.
