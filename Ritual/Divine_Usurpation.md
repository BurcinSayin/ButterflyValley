## The Rite of Divine Usurpation
This ritual is the secret part of "The Ritual of Eternal Unity" it is performed under the cover of "The Ritual of Eternal Unity" and what actually gives selected Eternal Vanguard clergy to cast divine spells

### Components (in addition to the public components):
- A hidden receptacle for the attunement elixir
- A specially prepared elixir infused with trace elements from the central divine power repository
- A set of mystical sigils carved into the altar, to prevent detection of elixir and receptacle
- A unique and personal focus object for the initiate (a specially created item marked with their blood, a lock of hair, etc.)

### Ceremony (secret elements interwoven with the public ritual):
1.  Before the initiate enters, the officiating High Inquisitor activates the hidden receptacle on the altar, creating a syncronization field. The attunement elixir is syncronized withe person in this field.
2.  As the hymn is sung, the High Inquisitor mentally recites an occult incantation, preparing to establish a link between the initiate and the Vanguard's **divine power repository**.
3.  When the initiate kneels, they unknowingly position themselves within the syncronization field.
4.  The oath taken by the initiate serves as a verbal component of the secret ritual, binding their soul to the Vanguard's power source.
5.  The water in the chalice is actually the prepared elixir, designed to **attune the initiate's spirit** to the frequency of the siphoned divine power stored in the central repository.
6.  As the initiate is anointed, the elixir creates a spiritual conduit for the divine power to flow into their body.
7.  The presented warhammer is imbued with a latent charge from the repository and is ritually linked to the initiate's personal focus object. This focus object becomes the true **key and anchor** for their connection to the divine repository.
8.  The invocation by the Minister masks the true ritual being performed by the High Inquisitor, which forges the permanent link, allowing divine power from the central repository to be channeled into the initiate through their focus object.
9.  The communal meditation at the end serves to stabilize the newly formed link and mask any visible signs of the transformation.

### Outcomes:
- The initiate gains the ability to cast divine spells by **drawing power from the Vanguard's central repository** through the newly established link. They believe this power comes from the Vanguard's collective spiritual energy.
- The siphoned divine power is bound to the initiate via their personal focus object. This object is securely held by the Eternal Vanguard's high management, and as long as it remains intact under their control, the effects of the ritual continue.
- Knowledge of the focus object's existence, its true purpose, and its secure location is restricted to high-level Vanguard officials (those privy to the Rite of Divine Usurpation's secrets).
- The initiate remains unaware of the true source of their power and the existence or nature of this focus object, fully believing in the Vanguard's public doctrine.
- If the focus object is broken, destroyed, or intentionally unbound by the Vanguard high management, the initiate's **link to the repository is severed**, and they immediately lose all divine powers granted by this ritual.

This dual-nature ritual allows the Eternal Vanguard to maintain their public facade while secretly distributing the power gained through the Divine Power Siphon ritual. The ceremony's true nature remains hidden from the initiated and the public, known only to the highest ranks of the Vanguard.

### Special Note: Born Divine Casters

In rare cases, individuals may manifest the ability to cast what appear to be Eternal Vanguard divine spells without undergoing the Rite of Divine Usurpation. This phenomenon is attributed to four primary factors:

1. **Attunement to Living Gods:** Some individuals' personal beliefs and spiritual alignment are so strongly attuned to a still-living god that they naturally draw power from that deity.
2. **Resonance with Siphoned Divine Essence:** In other cases, an individual's personal beliefs and spiritual nature may closely align with a god whose power has been drained by the Divine Power Siphon ritual. This alignment creates a natural conduit for the flow of divine energy from the siphoned essence to the individual, bypassing the need for the formal ritual.
3. **Temporal Anomalies:** The Eternal Vanguard's extensive manipulation of time has created pockets of temporal instability throughout Golarion. Individuals born within or exposed to these anomalies may develop a unique connection to the divine power that transcends the normal flow of time. These casters might draw power from past or future versions of gods, or even from deities that no longer exist in the current timeline.
4. **Fragmentary Divine Essence:** The process of siphoning divine power is not perfect, and sometimes fragments of a god's essence escape during the ritual. These divine fragments may seek out individuals whose beliefs or actions align with the god's former portfolio.When such a fragment bonds with a mortal, it can grant them divine spellcasting abilities.

These spontaneous casters present both an opportunity and a challenge for the Eternal Vanguard:

- They are carefully monitored and often fast-tracked for important positions within the organization, as they represent a valuable resource of divine power.
- The Vanguard sees them as potential assets but also as potential threats, especially those connected to living gods or temporal anomalies.
- Their existence is kept strictly confidential. To the public and lower ranks, they are presented as prodigies specially blessed by the collective spirit of the Vanguard, maintaining the illusion of the Vanguard's divine mandate.
- The inner circle of the Vanguard dedicates significant resources to studying these individuals, hoping to better understand the nature of divine power and how to fully control or eliminate it.
- Cases involving temporal anomalies or fragmentary divine essence are of particular interest, as they challenge the Vanguard's understanding of their own powers and the nature of divinity itself.
