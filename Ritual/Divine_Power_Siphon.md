# Divine Power Siphon
*Unique Occult Ritual 10*\
**Traditions** occult\
**Cast** 1 day; **Cost** rare incense and offerings worth 10,000 gp;\
**Secondary Casters** 5
**Primary Check** Occultism (legendary); **Secondary Checks** Religion, Arcana, Medicine\
**Range** 1 mile;\
**Targets** one dead or weakened deity whose portfolio is within 1 mile\
**Duration** permanent

This blasphemous ritual allows the casters to siphon the raw divine power of a dead or severely weakened deity. The harvested essence is not meant for granting unique abilities to a select few, but rather to be stored in specialized arcane repositories. From there, it can be distributed on a mass scale to the Eternal Vanguard's faithful, granting them the ability to cast divine spells. It requires access to an area that was strongly aligned to the deity's portfolio.

**Critical Success:** The ritual flawlessly siphons a vast quantity of the target deity's remaining essence. This divine power is successfully channeled into a designated repository, sufficient to empower thousands of followers with the ability to cast divine spells. The connection is stable, and the harvested power is pure. In addition to the harvested essence, the primary caster can choose up to two casters (including themselves) who participated in the ritual. Each chosen caster is permanently invested with a special power, a divine boon directly related to the portfolio of the siphoned deity ( see Major Boons in deity descriptions for examples ). The nature of this boon is determined by the GM.

**Success** The ritual siphons a significant portion of the deity's power. The harvested essence is enough to empower a large number of followers, though it may be less stable, requiring additional purification before it can be distributed. In addition to the harvested essence, the primary caster can choose one caster (including themselves) who participated in the ritual. The chosen caster is permanently invested with a minor special power, a divine boon related to the portfolio of the siphoned deity ( see Moderate Boons in deity descriptions for examples ). The nature of this boon is determined by the GM.

**Failure** The ritual fails to establish a connection to the deity's fading essence. The rare incense and offerings are wasted with no effect.

**Critical Failure** The attempt to siphon divine power backfires spectacularly. The primary caster takes 10d6 negative energy damage as the deity's power turns against them. The area becomes spiritually contaminated, making future attempts at this ritual far more dangerous.

**Special: Targeting a Deity at Full Power**

Attempting to perform this ritual on a deity that is not already dead, dying, or otherwise in a significantly weakened state is an act of supreme arrogance and folly.

* **Increased Difficulty:** When targeting a deity at full power, the DCs of all primary and secondary checks for the ritual are increased by 20.
* **Divine Resistance:** If the casters succeed at the ritual checks despite the increased difficulty, the target deity can still resist the siphon. The deity must attempt a Will save. The outcome of this save determines the final result of the ritual.
    * **Critical Success:** The deity completely repels the siphon and reflects the full force of the ritual back at the casters. The casters suffer the effects of a Critical Failure, and the primary caster is utterly destroyed (no save). The deity becomes aware of the casters' location and identity.
    * **Success:** The deity successfully fights off the siphoning attempt. The ritual has no effect on the deity. The casters suffer the effects of a Failure, and the psychic backlash is strong enough to make the casters' location known to the deity or their most powerful servants.
    * **Failure:** The deity is unable to fully resist. The ritual is treated as a Success (not a Critical Success), allowing the casters to siphon a modest portion of power. The deity is temporarily wounded and weakened but will seek retribution.
    * **Critical Failure:** The deity is overwhelmed by the ritual. The casters' ritual is treated as a Critical Success, and the deity is left significantly weakened, possibly for years or even centuries.
* **The Role of the Celestial Seed:** The primary purpose of the **Celestial Seed** is to circumvent this very resistance. A deity suffering from the "ontological instability" induced by an attuned Celestial Seed is considered "weakened" for the purposes of this ritual. They do not get to make a Divine Resistance saving throw and the DCs of the ritual checks are not increased. This makes the Celestial Seed an essential prerequisite for the Vanguard's plan to siphon power from living gods.
