# Ritual: Temporal Jump
**Rare Occult Ritual**
**Cast:** 1 day;
**Cost:** rare reagents worth 10,000gp; **Secondary Casters:** 3
**Primary Check:** Occultism (master); **Secondary Checks:** Arcana, Lore: Chronomancy
**Range:** 10 feet; **Target:** one to six willing creatures with the "Déjà Vu" ability
**Duration:** varies

This intricate ritual, developed by Butterfly Valley's founders, allows the casters to send one to six willing targets with the "Déjà Vu" ability backward in time. Due to the unique temporal properties of the Bastion, the ritual must be performed within its boundaries to maintain stability.

**Critical Success:** All targets arrive at the intended destination in the past without any ill effects, able to act immediately. When the duration ends or when the travelers enter the designated extraction point in the past, they return to the present at the ritual's casting location.

**Success:** The targets safely arrive at the destination time but are disoriented, taking 3d6 mental damage and becoming stunned 3. When the duration ends, they return to the designated extraction point, suffering the same effects.

**Failure:** The ritual fails to transport the targets through time. Any rare reagents are consumed. The targets suffer 6d6 mental damage and are stunned for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure:** The time travel goes disastrously wrong. The targets take 10d6 mental damage and vanish without a trace. The casters are unable to determine if the targets travelled to an alternate timeline, were erased from history, or met some other grim fate.

### Special:
- Only creatures with the "Déjà Vu" ability can be targeted by this ritual. Their unique temporal resonance allows them to maintain coherence during time travel.
- The targets' attunement to temporal energies enables travel to any point in time, though traveling beyond one's natural lifespan causes an additional 2d6 mental damage upon arrival and return.
- The ritual requires establishing an extraction point - a specific location in the past that serves as an emergency temporal anchor. When entered, this point triggers an immediate return to the present.
- Duration must be precisely calculated during casting. The ritual automatically recalls travelers when this duration expires.
- Each century of temporal displacement increases the strain on travelers, causing an additional 1d6 mental damage upon arrival and return.
- Compromised extraction points cause temporal turbulence, resulting in return displacement within 1 mile of the Bastion.
- While the ritual's magic helps stabilize minor temporal paradoxes, major alterations to the timeline can have severe consequences.

### Known Temporal Phenomena:
1. **Temporal Phase Disruption:** Travelers may experience periods where their temporal coherence fluctuates, causing them to phase between timelines. During these episodes, they become incorporeal and cannot interact with the physical world until their temporal signature restabilizes.

2. **Timeline Cross-Threading:** The ritual sometimes creates unexpected connections between different temporal threads, causing agents from other time periods to temporarily replace displaced travelers. These replacements return to their original timeline once temporal coherence is restored.

3. **Chrono-Stalker Interference:** Local Chrono-Stalkers can disrupt a traveler's temporal signature, forcing them into stasis until the interference can be cleared. Affected individuals have no memory of their time in stasis.

4. **Temporal Confluence:** The ritual occasionally generates convergence points where different temporal threads intersect, allowing additional agents to join ongoing missions through these natural temporal crossroads.

5. **Sympathetic Temporal Bonding:** Travelers develop a temporal resonance with each other during the ritual. This creates a form of temporal tether between all participants. When a majority of the bonded travelers moves between timelines (either returning to the present or remaining in the past), their temporal resonance pulls the minority with them. This sympathetic bond ensures the group remains temporally unified.

These temporal effects were extensively documented by the ritual's creators through careful observation and experimentation. Understanding and accounting for these phenomena is crucial for successful temporal operations.
