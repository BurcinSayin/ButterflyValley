This potent and extremely difficult ritual allows the casters to isolate a single, specific aspect, property, or power from a source and permanently transfer it to a destination. The aspect could be a creature's innate ability (like a phase spider's ability to shift between planes), a magical property from an object (like cold iron's resistance to fey magic), or a fundamental natural quality (like the regenerative properties of a troll's blood).

The ritual is incredibly taxing and requires a deep, sympathetic understanding of the essence being transferred. The GM determines the DC of all checks based on the compatibility and power difference between the source and the destination. Transferring a minor trait is difficult, while transferring a major power is a task of legendary proportions.

**Examples of Use:**
* **Source:** A captured will-o'-wisp. **Destination:** A masterfully crafted bullseye lantern. **Desired Aspect:** The wisp's innate electrical energy. The ritual would aim to create a lantern that glows with perpetual, crackling lightning instead of mundane light.
* **Source:** The heartwood of an ancient, petrified tree. **Destination:** A warrior's steel shield. **Desired Aspect:** The wood's unnatural resilience. The ritual would attempt to imbue the shield with a portion of the petrified wood's legendary toughness.

**Critical Success** You flawlessly transfer the desired aspect from the source to the destination. The destination creature or item permanently gains the intended power or property in its full form. The source is weakened but not destroyed; a creature might lose the transferred ability, and an item might become a mundane, non-magical version of itself.

**Success** You successfully transfer the aspect, but the transference is incomplete or comes with a complication. The destination gains a lesser or flawed version of the power. For example, the lantern might glow with lightning, but it periodically shorts out, requiring a command word to reignite. The shield may gain increased Hardness but also becomes brittle against a specific type of damage (like sonic). The source object is destroyed or the source creature is permanently drained, taking a major penalty to its Constitution.

**Failure** The ritual fails catastrophically. The unstable energies consume both the source and the destination, utterly destroying them in a brilliant flash of elemental power. All casters are stunned for 1d4 rounds by the psychic backlash.

**Critical Failure** The ritual implodes, turning the casters into the focal point of the failed transference. Both the source and destination are annihilated. The occult and elemental energies, having no vessel, violently backlash into the casters themselves. Each caster (primary and secondary) is afflicted with a permanent, debilitating spiritual wound, gaining a unique curse related to the essence being transferred (GM's discretion). For example, if attempting to transfer a wisp's electricity, a caster's body might become uncontrollably conductive, attracting lightning and taking extra damage from electrical attacks. Furthermore, all casters are drained 4 and this condition can only be removed by powerful magic such as `wish` or `miracle`.
