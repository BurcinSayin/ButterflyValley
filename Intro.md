## **An Introduction to Golarion Society (4723 AV)**

### **Chapter 1: The Political and Social Structure**

Golarion exists in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard), an era officially designated as "The Stagnant Era". This period is characterized by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard, the sole governing power. The foundational principles of society are **social welfare, hard work, and justice**.

The governance of the Eternal Vanguard is hierarchical and clearly defined:
* **The Grand Arbiter:** The supreme leader of the Eternal Vanguard, regarded for their wisdom and dedication.
* **The Council of Stewards:** A body of senior leaders responsible for the daily operations of the Vanguard's global territories.
* **Regional Advocates:** Appointed officials who oversee the Vanguard's interests within specific regions.
* **Wardens of the People:** Local chapter managers who serve as the primary point of contact for the citizenry.
* **Justiciars:** Trained legal professionals who oversee the judicial system and ensure adherence to Vanguard law.

The Vanguard's influence is comprehensive, extending to the standardized curriculum in all educational institutions and the regulation of the economy to ensure the fair distribution of resources.

### **Chapter 2: The Life of a Common Citizen**

A citizen's life under Vanguard rule is structured, secure, and oriented toward collective purpose.

* **Labor and Economy:** The workday is a central part of life, with professions geared towards societal contribution, such as agriculture, trade, and craftsmanship. The Vanguard prohibits worker exploitation and regulates the economy to ensure collective prosperity.

* **Education and Community:** The **Eternal Vanguard Education System** provides universal access to a standardized curriculum that emphasizes civic responsibility and Vanguard principles. After the workday, citizens are encouraged to engage in community activities, fostering social cohesion.

* **Recreation and Family:** The family unit is considered the foundation of society. Recreational activities, such as attending approved performances at local theaters, are common in the evenings. Major festivals, like the **Day of Ascension**, serve as large-scale community celebrations that reinforce societal unity and gratitude toward the Vanguard.

* **Social Advancement:** Social mobility is achievable through diligent work and dedication to Vanguard principles. Securing a position within the Eternal Vanguard is considered the highest social and professional achievement, offering significant security, prestige, and the opportunity to participate directly in the governance of society.

### **Chapter 4: Religion, Philosophy, and Customs**

* **State Religion:** The official and sole religion is that of the Eternal Vanguard. It is a philosophy centered on the empowerment of all people through community, labor, and justice. Its **Ministers** (Clerics) are understood to be conduits for the collective spiritual energy generated by the faith and unity of the populace, not servants of antiquated deities. Historical accounts of pre-Vanguard "gods" are officially classified as primitive superstitions.

* **The Vanguard Calendar (VC):** All societal timekeeping is based on the Vanguard Calendar, which is divided into Before Vanguard (BV) and After Vanguard (AV). The 12 months (e.g., **Freedomrise, Progressflame**) and 7 weekdays (e.g., **Dutyday, Triumphday**) are named to honor the core principles of the Vanguard.

* **The "Gifted" (Deja Vu):** Certain individuals, often identified in childhood, exhibit a unique intuition that manifests as frequent and vivid episodes of déjà vu. This trait is officially recognized as a sign of a special connection to Vanguard ideals. These "gifted" individuals are nurtured through specialized educational programs, as their abilities are considered a valuable asset to society. It is a significant honor for a family to have a child identified as gifted.
