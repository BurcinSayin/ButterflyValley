# Welcome to Golarion, Gerard Frank

## Your World

Welcome to Golarion in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard). You were born during a time known as "The Stagnant Era," a period marked by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. As a child blessed - or perhaps cursed - with the "Deja Vu" ability, your life has been far from ordinary.

## Your Background 

You are Gerard Frank, a 20-year-old human from the small coastal village of Souston. Your father, Markus Frank, is a humble fisherman and your mother, Eliza Frank, is a seamstress. You have a younger sister named Lily, who is 5 years younger than you. Life in Souston was simple but happy, filled with days of fishing with your father, helping your mother with her sewing, playing on the beach, and looking after Lily.

However, everything changed when you turned 12. Your "Deja Vu" ability, which manifested as vivid sensations of knowing what was about to happen moments before it occurred, caught the attention of the Eternal Vanguard. They came for you, claiming it was for your own good and the good of society.

## Education and Training

You were taken to Almas, the capital city of Andoran, to begin your education at the prestigious Starfall Academy. Here, you were groomed to become an Inquisitor, a future Justiciar of the Eternal Vanguard. Your days were filled with rigorous training, both physical and mental, as they aimed to shape you into a perfect tool of the Vanguard.

A turning point came when you began to display divine powers without undergoing the sacred Ritual of Eternal Unity. This caught the attention of your superiors, who decided to transfer you to Vanguard City for "higher education."

## Vanguard City and Growing Doubts

In Vanguard City, your training intensified. You were subjected to rigorous indoctrination aimed at ensuring loyalty to the Vanguard's principles. However, as your education progressed, you began to notice inconsistencies between the Vanguard's ideals and the actions of some of its officers.

Your "Deja Vu" experiences became more frequent and intense, often giving you an unsettling feeling that something wasn't quite right. This nagging sensation of "wrongness" grew stronger with each passing day, though you couldn't pinpoint its exact source.

You began to question your superiors, seeking clarification on the discrepancies you perceived between the Vanguard's teachings and the behavior of some of its representatives. However, your questions were met with stern admonishments and punishments. You were told to obey without question, that the Vanguard's wisdom was absolute.

## Resistance and Imprisonment

Despite the pressure to conform, you couldn't ignore the doubts gnawing at your mind. You continued to probe, to question, seeking to understand why some Vanguard officers seemed to contradict the very ideals they were meant to uphold. Your resistance to their explanations did not go unnoticed.

Now, at the age of 20, you find yourself in a high-security prison. You've been here for about a year, isolated and constantly monitored. Your crime? Persistently questioning the actions of Vanguard officers and refusing to accept explanations that didn't align with the Vanguard's stated principles.

## Your Abilities and Resolve

Despite your imprisonment, you hold onto your newfound divine powers. You don't understand their source, but they give you strength. Your "Deja Vu" ability has also grown stronger, often giving you split-second foreknowledge of events just before they occur.

You are determined to understand the contradictions you've observed, to reconcile the noble ideals of the Eternal Vanguard with the sometimes oppressive actions of its officers. You believe in the Vanguard's principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice, but you can't shake the feeling that something is fundamentally amiss in how these ideals are being implemented.

Remember, Gerard, your experiences and your inquisitive spirit make you unique. As you face the trials ahead, trust your instincts and never stop seeking to understand the truth behind the inconsistencies you've observed. You believe in the ideals of the Eternal Vanguard, but you're convinced that something has gone wrong in how those ideals are being put into practice by some of its representatives.
