# Welcome to Golarion, Zstelian Matei

## Your World

Welcome to Golarion in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard). You were born during a time known as "The Stagnant Era," a period marked by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. As a child blessed - or perhaps cursed - with the "Deja Vu" ability, your life has been far from ordinary.

## Your Background

You are Zstelian Matei, a 20-year-old Varisian from a renegade gypsy tribe in Varisia. Your early life was spent traveling with your people, learning the ways of the road, the secrets of fortune-telling, and the ancient lore of your people. However, your path took a drastic turn when you were just 10 years old.

The tribe's seer had a prophecy about you:

- *Born under many moons, a child of sight,*
- *Echoes of reality dance in their dreams at night.*
- *To the Vanguard's halls, this one must go,*
- *For in their hands, true freedom's seeds will grow.*

Despite the tribe's deep distrust of the Eternal Vanguard and their nomadic lifestyle that had kept them free from Vanguard control, they could not ignore the seer's words. With heavy hearts, they sent you to the city of Ravenhold as they continued their journey.

## Life in Ravenhold

For two years, you lived in the slums of Ravenhold, a far cry from the open wilds of your homeland. You had to adapt quickly to survive in this urban jungle, learning the ways of the city just as you had once learned the ways of the land.

## Discovery and Education

When you were 12, your "Deja Vu" ability caught the attention of the Eternal Vanguard. They took you from the slums and placed you in the Starfall Academy, a prestigious institution dedicated to shaping young minds in the Vanguard's image.

At the Academy, your days were filled with rigorous studies and indoctrination into the Vanguard's ideology. Despite the comforts of a stable roof over your head and regular meals, you couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

When you were 15, you shocked everyone, including yourself, when you displayed divine powers without having undergone the sacred Ritual of Eternal Unity. This miracle caught the eye of the Vanguard's higher echelons, and you were swiftly transferred to Vanguard City for "higher education."

## Strange Experiences in Vanguard City

In Vanguard City, the contradictions in the Vanguard's teachings became more apparent to you. Their words of freedom and justice seemed to clash with the reality of their strict control and suppression of dissent.

During your time in Vanguard City, you underwent some unusual experiences. After certain health examinations, you often felt strangely ill, with symptoms unlike any sickness you'd experienced before. Following some particularly intense training sessions, you suffered from severe headaches and vivid, unsettling nightmares.

These experiences left you feeling disoriented and uneasy. The nightmares were especially troubling, filled with fragmented and confusing images that felt oddly real. Sometimes, you would wake up with a sense that something important had happened, but you could never quite grasp what it was.

You found it difficult to talk about these experiences with others. When you tried, the Vanguard officials dismissed your concerns, assuring you that such reactions were normal for someone undergoing advanced education and training. Despite their reassurances, you couldn't shake the feeling that something more was happening, even if you couldn't put your finger on exactly what it was.

## Your Defiance and Current Situation

Despite the Vanguard's efforts to mold you into a loyal servant, you couldn't ignore the growing sense that something was fundamentally wrong with the world. Your lack of compliance frustrated the Justiciars, and their methods became increasingly harsh.

At the age of 19, you found yourself in a high-security prison, isolated and constantly monitored. Your crime? Being born with a gift that the Vanguard could not control, and daring to question their absolute authority.

## Your Strength and Your Destiny

At age 20, despite the hardships you've endured, you have not broken. Your divine powers, though not fully understood, give you strength. And your "Deja Vu" ability whispers of a world beyond the Vanguard's control.

You are Zstelian Matei, a child of the open sky and the spirits. Your path has been hard, but it is not over. Remember the seer's words - in your hands, true freedom's seeds will grow. You have a destiny larger than the Vanguard's prison cells, and a spirit too wild to be tamed by their ideology.

In the trials to come, trust in your abilities, your instincts, and the wisdom of your ancestors. The world is waiting for you, Zstelian. Your journey is just beginning.
