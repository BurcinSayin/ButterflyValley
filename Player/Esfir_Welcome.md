# Welcome to Golarion, Esfir

## Your World

Welcome to Golarion in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard). You were born during a time known as "The Stagnant Era," a period marked by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. As a child blessed - or perhaps cursed - with the "Deja Vu" ability, your life has been far from ordinary.

## Your Background

You are Esfir, a 24-year-old human woman from Irrisen, born to Kasia and Bogdan in the town of Waldsby. Your early years were spent helping your parents with their farming duties, learning the rhythms of the land even in Irrisen's harsh climate. Your mother's gentle wisdom and your father's practical knowledge helped shape your understanding of the natural world.

## The Journey to Riba

In 4710 AV, when you were ten, your family made the difficult decision to relocate to Riba, a smaller and more remote village. The journey through Irrisen's unforgiving wilderness was harsh and treacherous, but it was during this challenging time that you experienced something extraordinary - you found an orphaned Snowfang tiger cub, a rare creature native to Irrisen's most remote regions. Despite the additional hardship it would bring, your parents allowed you to keep the cub, recognizing the unique bond that had formed between you. 

## Life in Riba

Your family established a small farm on the outskirts of Riba, working hard to build a new life. It was here, surrounded by wilderness, that your connection to nature deepened. Your tiger companion grew alongside you, and together you learned to navigate both the natural world and the complexities of life under Vanguard rule.

## The Awakening of Power

During your teenage years, you discovered your ability to communicate with nature in ways that went beyond normal understanding. Your druidic powers manifested gradually, intertwining with your innate "Deja Vu" experiences. These abilities seemed to resonate with the ancient magic that still lingered in Irrisen's landscape.

## Life as a Caravan Guard

At age 20, you began working as a caravan guard, putting your unique abilities and your companion's strength to use protecting travelers along Irrisen's dangerous routes. Your reputation for reliability and your unusual partnership with a Snowfang tiger made you a sought-after guard.

## Education and Imprisonment

Your abilities eventually caught the attention of Vanguard authorities, who arranged for your transfer to Whitethrone for "special education." Despite your initial hopes that this might be an opportunity to better understand your gifts, the experience proved to be far more restrictive than educational. Within a year, you found yourself imprisoned, your abilities deemed too unpredictable for standard education programs.

## Current Situation

Now, at age 23, you find yourself in a high-security prison, separated from your faithful tiger companion. Your crime? Being born different, with abilities that the Vanguard cannot fully control or understand. Yet even in confinement, your connection to nature remains strong, and your "Deja Vu" experiences continue to provide glimpses of possibilities that others cannot see.

Remember, Esfir, that your unique combination of druidic power and strange Deja Vu visions makes you special. As you face the trials ahead, draw strength from your connection to nature, your bond with your companion, and your experiences surviving in one of Golarion's harshest regions.
