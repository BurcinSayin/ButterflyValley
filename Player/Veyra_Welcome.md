# Welcome to Golarion, Veyra Drosk

## Your World

Welcome to Golarion in the year 4723 AV (After Vanguard). You were born in the grand capital itself, [Vanguard City](../Location/Inner_Sea/Vanguard_City.md), during a time known as "The Stagnant Era," a period marked by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. As a child blessed—or perhaps cursed—with the ["Deja Vu"](../Background/DejaVu.md) ability, your life has been far from ordinary.

## From Riches to Rags

You were born into the wealthy Drosk family, a line of influential merchants in Vanguard City. Your early life was one of privilege and education; you learned the intricacies of business from your father while your uncle, a man of more flexible morals, taught you the arts of trickery, smuggling, and fraud. You learned that money could be made in many ways, not all of them savory. This idyllic life came to a crashing halt when your family's assets were seized, and they went bankrupt, losing everything. The sting of poverty and the memory of your former life instilled in you a fierce determination to never be powerless again.

## An Unexpected Opportunity

With your formal education cut short by your family's financial ruin, the Eternal Vanguard's offer of "special education" for those with the Deja Vu ability seemed like a golden opportunity. Publicly, it was a benevolent program to help gifted individuals reach their full potential; secretly, it was a system to identify and indoctrinate those with unique abilities for the Vanguard's own purposes. You saw it as a chance to complete your education and regain a foothold in the world, a path back to the life you had lost.

During your time at the academy, you underwent strange and unsettling experiences. After certain "health examinations," you often felt strangely ill, with symptoms unlike any normal sickness. Following some of the more intense "ideological training sessions," you suffered from severe headaches, vivid nightmares, and moments of disorientation, as if struggling with memories that weren't your own. You were assured these were normal side effects of advanced learning, but you now suspect they were flawed attempts at memory alteration, designed to ensure loyalty.

## Defiance and Escape

Despite the Vanguard's efforts to mold you, you couldn't ignore the growing sense that something was fundamentally wrong with the world. The more they tried to ensure your compliance, the more your sharp mind and your uncle's lessons in subterfuge made you resist. Your lack of conformity frustrated the Justiciars, and you were eventually detained for "re-education".

Knowing that a transfer to a high-security facility like Yvuvho Prison was imminent, you used your wits to orchestrate a swift escape. Leveraging your intimate knowledge of [Vanguard City](../Location/Inner_Sea/Vanguard_City.md)'s rhythms and your skill with forged [documents](../Equipment/Vanguard_Authorization_Documents.md), you vanished from a low-security holding area before the official transfer could be completed.

## A Fugitive's Life

For months, you lived on the run, a ghost in the system you knew so well. It was during this time that you were contacted by agents of the **Liberators' Dawn**, a clandestine organization dedicated to opposing Vanguard tyranny. They had been monitoring you, impressed by your skills and your defiance. They offered you a choice: continue to hide, or join them and fight back. You chose to fight.

Your effectiveness as an agent for Liberators' Dawn did not go unnoticed by the Vanguard. To neutralize you and dismantle your support network, they enacted a brutal plan. They murdered your family and publicly framed you for the crime, painting you as a monstrous patricide and turning you into one of the most wanted fugitives in Vanguard City.

## The Raid and Rescue

The frame-up worked. Public sentiment turned against you, and the Vanguard had the perfect excuse to act. A special operations squad, operating under a "kill-on-sight" order, raided the Liberators' Dawn safehouse where you were hiding. They stormed the location, intent on slaughtering you and your allies, branding everyone inside as accomplices to murder.

In the midst of the bloody chaos, as your friends and comrades fell around you, something impossible happened. Three figures appeared in a shimmer of temporal energy. They were not Vanguard. They moved with a purpose and power you had never seen, dispatching the Vanguard assassins with practiced ease. They were Temporal Agents from the Bastion. They knew who you were and the importance of your Deja Vu ability. Without a word, they grabbed you and pulled you into a swirling vortex of energy, extracting you from the timeline moments before the Vanguard squad could finish its grim work.

## Life as a Temporal Agent

You awoke in the [Bastion](../Organisation/Butterfly_Valley/Bastion_Governance.md), a hidden sanctuary on a demi-plane outside the normal flow of time. Here, you found a community of rebels, scholars, and warriors, all united in their opposition to the Eternal Vanguard. Given your unique Deja Vu abilities, you were inducted into their most elite ranks, becoming a **Temporal Agent** for [Butterfly Valley](../Organisation/Butterfly_Valley/Info.md).

Your missions now take you across time itself, using the [Temporal Jump](../Ritual/Temporal_Jump.md) ritual to travel to the past to counter the Vanguard's machinations. The work is perilous, not just from the Vanguard agents you face, but from the very nature of time travel. Each jump leaves its mark; you often return to the Bastion disoriented, suffering from splitting headaches, a confused mind, and sometimes collapsing into unconsciousness as your senses struggle to realign with the present.

These journeys into the past, however, have yielded terrible truths. Sifting through old records and observing events from the shadows of history, you uncovered the Vanguard's direct involvement in your family's downfall. Their bankruptcy wasn't a matter of misfortune; it was a calculated act, orchestrated by the Vanguard to make you desperate and pliable, ensuring you would accept their offer of "education."

Even more chilling was the discovery you made about the raid on the Liberators' Dawn. The strike team wasn't there to eliminate a rebel cell; their primary target was *you*. The murder of your comrades was simply collateral damage in their single-minded pursuit to eliminate a Deja Vu individual they could not control.

Driven by a burning desire for revenge, you have turned the lessons of your past into the weapons of your future. You live in the Bastion, a shadow in the Vanguard's world, fighting for a future where you can claim justice for your family and ensure no one else suffers their fate.
