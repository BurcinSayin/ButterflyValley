# Liberators' Dawn

## Overview

Liberators' Dawn is a clandestine organization that has emerged in opposition to the rule of the Eternal Vanguard. Operating from the shadows, the group dedicates itself to aiding those who feel oppressed by the Vanguard's authority.

## Origins and Objectives

Founded in 4715 AV, Liberators' Dawn was formed by a collection of escaped political prisoners and individuals who had grown disillusioned with the Eternal Vanguard's governance. The organization's primary goals are to:

* Assist and offer protection to those facing oppression under the Vanguard.
* Gather and share information about history from the era before the Vanguard's rise.
* Disrupt the Vanguard's operations and undermine their control.
* Recruit new members from diverse backgrounds to strengthen their cause.
* Create a network of safe houses and escape routes for fugitives.

## Structure

The organization is led by a five-member body known as **The Dawning Council**. Below the council, the group is organized into specialized branches:

* **Illuminators**: Tasked with information gathering and espionage.
* **Shieldbearers**: Specialize in extracting and protecting fugitives.
* **Torchbearers**: Focus on education and spreading information to counter Vanguard propaganda.
* **Shadowcrafters**: Experts in covert operations, including subterfuge and forgery.

## Key Alliances

* **Knights of Lastwall**: Following the events of the altered "Tyrant's Grasp," Liberators' Dawn has forged a strong alliance with the newly re-established Knights of Lastwall. This independent order actively resists the Eternal Vanguard in the Gravelands region, and their partnership with Liberators' Dawn marks a significant development in the organized opposition to Vanguard rule.

## Areas of Operation

Liberators' Dawn is active in several regions across Golarion, typically where Vanguard control is strong but not absolute. Their most active cells are reported to be in:

* **Varisia**: Centered around **Ravenhold**, they focus on liberating oppressed Shoanti and Varisian minorities and sabotaging Vanguard mining operations.
* **Andoran**: Operating primarily in **Almas**, this cell infiltrates administrative centers and supports underground movements.
* **Cheliax**: From **Westcrown**, they work to undermine Vanguard-aligned nobles and aid escaped slaves.
* **Kyonin**: Based near **Iadara's Refuge**, this group safeguards elven lore and assists those resisting Vanguard indoctrination.
* **Ustalav**: Operating out of **Caliphas**, they focus on preserving historical records and protecting intellectual freedoms.
