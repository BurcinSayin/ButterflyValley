## Recent Developments & Official Position
Recently, the Eternal Vanguard's stance on the "Butterfly Valley" myth has shifted. Previously dismissed as harmless folklore, it is now viewed with increased concern due to the accelerating **Temporal Crisis**. Vanguard officials have noted a correlation between the proliferation of these tales and rising instances of temporal anomalies.

Publicly, the Vanguard now advises that indulging in such myths can be a sign of temporal-related distress. They have increased their hunt for and monitoring of individuals with the **"Deja Vu"** ability, framing it as a measure to protect these "gifted" but vulnerable citizens from dangerous temporal fluctuations. The official position is that while Butterfly Valley itself may not be real, the ideas it represents are being exploited by forces that seek to undermine stability during the crisis.
