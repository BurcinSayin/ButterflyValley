## The Bastion's Governance Structure

The governance of the Bastion is divided into two distinct but interconnected entities: the **Bastion City Management**, which handles the day-to-day civic administration of the refugee city, and **The Temporal Resistance (Butterfly Valley Organization)**, the covert group focused on combating the Eternal Vanguard.

### Bastion City Management (The Bastion Council)

The Bastion Council is responsible for the stable, present-day governance of Bastion City and its growing population of refugees. All council members are **Deja Vu Negative**, reflecting their focus on civic matters rather than temporal operations.

**The Bastion Council Members:**

* **Head of Council: Lyria Shadowmend** 
* **Head of Resources (The Provider): Finn Brightleaf** 
* **Head of Civic Security & Order: Viktor Ironguard**

* **Chief of Non-Temporal Archives & Civic Education:**

* **Department of Civic Security:** Maintains internal law and order and manages the city guard.
* **Department of Community & Welfare:** Manages housing, general healthcare, and social support services.

* **Department of Refugee Integration (Non-Deja Vu Focus):** Manages the reception and integration of new non-Deja Vu refugees, while remaining vigilant against potential Vanguard infiltrators.

### The Temporal Resistance (Butterfly Valley Organization)

The Temporal Resistance is the core organization dedicated to combating the Eternal Vanguard's manipulation of the timeline. Its membership consists almost exclusively of individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability.

### Relationship Between City and Resistance

Bastion City Management maintains a tolerant, though not formally allied, relationship with the Temporal Resistance. The City Council recognizes that the Bastion owes its existence to the Resistance's efforts. However, the Council's primary duty is to the safety and welfare of the city's permanent residents. This can lead to friction over resource allocation and the security risks posed by the Resistance's covert operations against the Eternal Vanguard.
