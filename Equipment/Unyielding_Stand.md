**Appearance:**
This jagged shard of celestial metal, about the length of a human finger, gleams with an internal silver light that occasionally pulses with a righteous crimson hue. Its edges are preternaturally sharp, and it feels constantly warm to the touch. Faint, almost imperceptible runes of duty, valor, and rightful vengeance seem to shift and flow across its surface when viewed in the light. It is known as a *Shard of the Unyielding Stand*.

**Powers:**
The *Shard of the Unyielding Stand* resonates with divine spellcasters who uphold justice and their sworn duties, acting as a direct conduit to the lingering essence of Ragathiel. You must invest the shard to benefit from its powers.

  * **Font of Lingering Divinity (Passive):** If you are a divine spellcaster who worships Ragathiel (or a righteous philosophy embodying his tenets of chivalry, duty, and vengeance against tyranny), you can draw upon the shard's direct connection to Ragathiel's enduring essence. You can prepare divine spells even if Ragahiels powers are not present or are blocked. This is not related to casting, duration or suppression of magic ( Dispells, Anti-Magic work as normal )

  * **Unyielding Stand:**\
  **Activation:** 1 Reaction (command, envision);\
  **Trigger:** You are affected by a spell which has a caster\
  **Frequency:** Once per day\
  **Duration:** 1 round\
  **Effect:** You gain a +1 status bonus to your AC or saving throw against spells. If the spell still affects you (either by hitting your AC or requiring a failed save \[*effects as a result of successful save does not trigger this*\]), the caster takes 1d6 spirit damage for each spell level of the triggering spell (DC \[Your Spell or Class DC whichever is higher\] basic Will save) as righteous energy surges back at them.\
  **Description:** You channel the shard's defensive energies to not only protect yourself but also to send a backlash of divine energy towards the offending spellcaster.

      * **Level 18:** You can use this ability twice per day. The spirit damage dealt to the caster increases to 1d10 per spell level. If the triggering spell is 5th level or lower, you automatically critically succeed at your saving throw (if any). If it's an attack roll, the caster takes a -3 circumstance penalty to their spell attack roll.
