This small, crystalline vial contains a faintly glowing, swirling liquid like fine dust that shifts between silver and blue hues. The vial feels strangely warm to the touch and emits a faint, almost imperceptible hum, reminiscent of the energy found in refined Starstone dust. It is believed to be a concentration of divine essence, painstakingly extracted and stabilized through forgotten alchemical processes.

**Crafting Requirements** Legendary proficiency in Alchemy; access to refined Starstone dust; knowledge of divine essence extraction.

The Spark of the Fallen Star can be used in one of two ways:

---

### 1. Anoint Holy Symbol

**Activate** 1 hour (ritualistic Interact); **Requirements** The Spark of the Fallen Star, a non-magical holy symbol, and the creature performing the anointing must be a devoted follower of the deity or philosophy the symbol represents.

You carefully anoint the holy symbol with the Spark of the Fallen Star, performing a private ritual of dedication. The Spark is consumed in the process. The holy symbol becomes permanently imbued with a direct link to raw divine essence, transforming it into an **Anchor of Faith**.

**Anchor of Faith (Passive)**
An *Anchor of Faith* serves as a personal conduit to a reservoir of divine power. If you use this *Anchor of Faith* as your divine focus, you can prepare your cleric, champion, or other divine spells and use your divine abilities (such as Lay on Hands, devotion spells, or domain powers) even if your direct connection to your deity is severed, blocked (for instance, by planar interference or if your deity has been eliminated or silenced by the Eternal Vanguard), or if the deityâ€™s power is otherwise inaccessible.

This item essentially provides a localized source of divine power sufficient for your needs. It does not grant new spells or abilities beyond what you could normally prepare or use, nor does it bypass effects that suppress or dispel magic (like *dispel magic* or an *antimagic field*), prevent spellcasting, or alter the duration of spells. The *Anchor of Faith* is a powerful artifact, as its existence challenges the Vanguard's narrative of controlling divine power.

### 2. Imbibe Essence

**Activate** (Interact); **Requirements** You must be a living creature.

You drink the Spark of the Fallen Star, and its raw divine power floods your being. For the next 10 minutes, you gain the ability to cast one divine spell of 5th level or lower from the cleric spell list (chosen at the time of drinking). You cast this spell as if you were a cleric of a sufficient level, using your highest mental ability score modifier (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) for the spell attack roll or DC. For the purpose of this spell, you are considered trained in divine spell attacks and DCs. The Spark of the Fallen Star is consumed.

**The Danger of Raw Power:** Imbibing such potent, unmediated divine essence is perilous. Upon drinking the Spark, you must immediately attempt a DC 35 Fortitude save.

* **Critical Success:** You channel the power with surprising ease, suffering no ill effects.
* **Success:** The influx is jarring. You are stupefied 1 for 1 hour as your mind reels.
* **Failure:** The raw divine power overwhelms your mortal form. You are stupefied 2 for 24 hours and take 8d6 mental damage as visions of shattered stars and cosmic chaos flood your mind.
* **Critical Failure:** The essence proves too volatile. You are stupefied 3 until cured, take 12d6 mental damage, and the GM chooses a minor divine backlash. This could be a temporary physical manifestation (e.g., your eyes glow with starlight for 24 hours), a strange compulsion, or attracting the attention of an entity sensitive to such raw divine outpourings (potentially including Vanguard chronomancers or other, stranger things drawn to Starstone energy).
