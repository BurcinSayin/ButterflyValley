#### **The Celestial Seed**

**Type:** Major Artifact
**Origin:** Forged over decades within the secret Vanguard research facility, the Celestial Lens.

#### **Physical Description**

The Celestial Seed is a significant artifact, roughly the size of a human fist and surprisingly heavy for its size, as if containing the compressed weight of its many stolen essences. Its shape is that of a raw, uncut Star Stone gem, but its surface is unnaturally smooth and cool to the touch, like polished obsidian.

At its heart, a captive galaxy of silver light swirls lazily, the original pure essence of the Star Stone. However, this core is now imprisoned within a chaotic, shimmering lattice of countless other colors and textures that shift and writhe just beneath the surface. Looking into its depths is disorienting; one might see flashes of angelic gold, demonic crimson, and the cold, geometric light of pure law locked in a silent, eternal war with roiling waves of protean chaos. Streaks of vibrant green from a treant's lifeblood pulse like veins, while the deep blue of a dragon's magic sparks erratically. The entire object feels subtly unstable, humming with a dissonant energy that is both fascinating and deeply unnerving to behold.

#### **Creation**

The Seed was created by performing the ***Essence Transference*** ritual hundreds of times, a process that took decades to complete within the Celestial Lens facility. Using a pure Star Stone as the unwavering destination, Vanguard researchers fed it a grotesque and diverse menu of sources to imbue it with a universal range of conceptual aspects. This process transformed it from a pure artifact into a composite monstrosity, a "universal key" whose multifaceted nature allows it to resonate with, and therefore affect, nearly any target.

The key essences were specifically chosen to target divine "Areas of Concern"â€”fundamental aspects of a deity's being and power that, while sources of strength, also create inherent vulnerabilities. By incorporating essences that resonate with these areas, the Seed is designed to bypass a god's natural defenses.

* **Primary Essences (Targeting Areas of Concern):**
    * **Concern: Alignment.** To target a god's core ethical and moral identity:
        * **Good:** From the feather of a slain renegade Angel.
        * **Evil:** Distilled from the captured heart of a powerful Glabrezu demon.
        * **Law:** Transferred from the core of a deactivated Kolyarut inevitable.
        * **Chaos:** Siphoned from the eternally shifting form of a captured Protean.
    * **Concern: Portfolio.** To target a god's connection to their domain of influence:
        * **Nature:** Extracted from the lifeblood of a century-old Treant.
        * **Magic:** Siphoned from the mind of an ancient Blue Dragon.
    * **Concern: Cosmic Principles.** To target a god's role in the fundamental mechanics of the multiverse:
        * **Fate & Karma:** The "unraveled destiny" of a mortal who successfully defied a prophecy from a Norn, imbuing the Seed with the concept of severed fate.
        * **Reincarnation & Death:** The captured last breath of a creature moments before it was raised as a powerful undead, infused with the essence of a Lich's phylactery. This corrupts the Seed with a mockery of the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth, allowing it to target deities who oversee souls and the afterlife.
* **Secondary Essences (for Stability and Function):**
    * **Structural Integrity:** From the scales of an Adamantine Dragon.
    * **Energy Channeling:** Distilled from the third eye of a Cyclops seer.
    * **Temporal Stability:** Siphoned from the sands of a captured Time Elemental.
    * **Magical Containment:** Distilled from the chaotic, magic-consuming essence of a captured Leydroth to prevent the energies from leaking or interacting negatively.

#### **Purpose and Function**

The Seed's purpose is to make a target vulnerable to the ***Divine Power Siphon*** ritual. Its method is one of universal resonance rather than singular focus.

* **Essence Resonance & Attunement:** By holding a multitude of conflicting aspects, the Seed can find a "sympathetic echo" in any target. The attunement process requires a material component with a powerful connection to the target (personal or symbolic) and a week-long ritual where the Seed locks onto the target's unique existential frequency.
* **Inducing Ontological Instability:** Once attuned, the Seed bombards the target's essence with the chaotic, contradictory principles it contains, effectively making the target's own power turn against itself. In addition the attunement works both ways, if the target has a portfolio ( it is a gol level being ) 60ft area around The Celestial Seed becomes aligned with one random aspect of the portfolio.
* **Enabling the Siphon:** A divine being afflicted by this instability finds it is hard to control their own power, making them exceptionally vulnerable to being drained by the ***Divine Power Siphon*** ritual.

#### **Properties and Powers**

* **Passive: Aura of Dissonance:** The Seed emits a constant, low-level psychic "noise". Creatures with strong auras (celestials, fiends, fey) are uncomfortable within 30 feet of it. Divination spells cast upon the bearer or the Seed return confusing and contradictory results.
* **Activated (1/day): Unravel Aspect**
    * **(Three Actions) Envision, Interact:** You present the Celestial Seed and focus its chaotic nature upon one target creature within 60 feet. The Seed resonates with the target's essence and attempts to temporarily unravel one of its core aspects. The target must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save.
    * **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected.
    * **Success:** The target is briefly destabilized and becomes slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds.
    * **Failure:** The target's essence is significantly unraveled. It is slowed 1 and becomes drained 2 for 1 minute.
    * **Critical Failure:** The target's nature is fundamentally compromised. It is paralyzed for 1 round, then becomes slowed 2 and drained 4 for 10 minutes.
* **Curse: Cacophony of Being:** The Seed screams in the bearer's mind with the fragmented consciousnesses of the creatures and forces sacrificed to create it. The bearer must succeed at a high-DC Will save each day or suffer the effects of a *confusion* spell for 1d10 minutes at a time of the GM's choosing. Long-term possession could lead to permanent madness.
