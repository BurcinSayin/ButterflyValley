You attempt to temporarily disrupt the target's ability to cast divine spells granted by the Eternal Vanguard's unorthodox methods. This requires you to succeed on a Counteract Check against the target.

**Outcome of the Counteract Check:**

* **Critical Success:** Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 3 levels higher than your effect’s counteract level. The target must attempt a Will save against your Spell DC, but they do so with a –2 circumstance penalty.
* **Success:** Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 1 level higher than your effect’s counteract level. The target must attempt a Will save against your Spell DC.
* **Failure:** Counteract the target if its counteract level is lower than your effect’s counteract level. The target must attempt a Will save against your Spell DC, but they do so with a +2 circumstance bonus.
* **Critical Failure:** The spell unravels improperly, causing psychic feedback. You are Stupefied 1 for 1 round.

**Will Save** (Attempted if Counteracting is possible):

* **Critical Success:** The target manages to maintain their spellcasting ability despite the disruption; the spell has no effect.
* **Success:** The target’s ability to cast Vanguard divine spells is suppressed for 1 round.
* **Failure:** The target’s ability to cast Vanguard divine spells is suppressed for 1 minute.
* **Critical Failure:** The target’s ability to cast Vanguard divine spells is suppressed for 1 minute, and they become Stupefied 1 for the duration due to the mental effort of trying to access their severed power. (This Stupefied condition further hampers their spellcasting and other mental actions).

---

* **Heightened (4th):** If the target critically fails their Will save, they are Stupefied 2 for the duration (instead of Stupefied 1).
* **Heightened (6th):** If the target critically fails their Will save, they are Stupefied 2 for the duration. The suppression duration on a simple failure of the Will save increases to 10 minutes. If the Counteract Check was a Critical Success, the penalty to the target's Will save is -3 (instead of -2), and if the Counteract Check was a Success, the penalty is -1.
