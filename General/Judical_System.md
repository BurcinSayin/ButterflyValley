# The Judicial System

The Eternal Vanguard has established a comprehensive and adaptable judicial system to ensure justice and order across Golarion. This system is designed to uphold the principles of the Vanguard while respecting local customs and traditions.

## Structure

1. **High Court:** Each kingdom's highest judicial authority, overseen by a Vanguard-appointed Chief Justiciar.
2. **Provincial Courts:** Handle major cases within provinces or large cities.
3. **Local Courts:** Address day-to-day legal matters in smaller communities.

## Justiciars

- Trained legal professionals, vetted and certified by the Eternal Vanguard.
- Serve as judges at all levels, adapting to local customs while upholding Vanguard principles.
- Local rulers may nominate candidates, but final approval comes from Vanguard representatives.

## Legal Code

- [**The Vanguard Codex:**](Vanguard_Codex.md) A core set of laws embodying fundamental Vanguard principles of order, duty, and social welfare.
