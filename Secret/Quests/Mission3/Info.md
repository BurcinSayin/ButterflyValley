# Mwangi Memory Seekers

## Original Timeline Events
* The Ekujae elves of the Mwangi Jungle maintained an unbroken presence in Golarion since before Earthfall
* Their oral traditions and hidden archives preserved unaltered historical records
* They developed a unique form of "living archives" - carefully grown and shaped trees that contain historical records in their very structure
* Only Elder Ekujae understand how to read these "living texts" encoded in branch patterns and leaf arrangements
* They maintained secret enclaves deep in the jungle, protected by natural barriers and ancient magic
* Their isolation helped them preserve knowledge of the old gods and pre-Vanguard history
* The Ekujae maintained a careful balance with outside forces through strategic isolation
* They served as crucial guardians against evil forces within the Mwangi Jungle
* Their magic included ancient techniques capable of harming divine beings
* A complex d√©tente existed between the Ekujae and the Eternal Vanguard

## Thread for Eternal Vanguard
* Discovery of unaltered historical records could expose Vanguard's temporal manipulations
* The Ekujae's living archive system has proven resistant to temporal manipulation due to its organic, continuously growing nature
* The existence of this record-keeping method could inspire resistance in other regions
* Risk of exposing ancient truths about:
    - The true nature of the gods' defeat
    - Original formation of the Eternal Vanguard
    - Unaltered accounts of major historical events
* The chaos of Tyrant's Grasp presents an opportunity to disturb the long-standing balance
* Recent intelligence suggests the Ekujae possess previously unknown historical records
* Top Vanguard leadership knows of their god-killing magic but keeps this secret even from most high-ranking members
* Primary concerns:
    - Risk of historical truth exposure
    - Potential loss of valuable magical knowledge
    - Disruption of regional stability if Ekujae are antagonized
    - Risk of their god-killing magic falling into wrong hands
* Secondary concerns:
    - Other factions might discover the truth during the chaos
    - Loss of regional stability during Tyrant's Grasp chaos

## Vanguard Interference Result
* The Vanguard maintains their careful approach but increases surveillance
* They establish a new research outpost near Ekujae territory under the pretense of "protecting the region from Tyrant's Grasp influence"
* Multiple "diplomatic missions" are sent to establish closer ties
* Covert attempts to:
    - Map Ekujae territory
    - Identify key elders
    - Document tree patterns (without understanding their meaning)
* Careful to avoid any actions that might trigger hostilities
* Local informants are recruited among nearby settlements

## Butterfly Valley Response
* Deploy agents familiar with both elven culture and jungle survival
* Establish contact with local Mwangi groups who trade with the Ekujae
* Primary objectives:
    - Make peaceful contact with Ekujae elders
    - Document any accessible historical records
    - Understand the nature of their record-keeping system
* Secondary objectives:
    - Monitor Vanguard activities in the region
    - Identify potential allies among local groups

## Final Result
[Awaiting player actions]
* Potential outcomes include:
    - Success in accessing historical records
    - Discovery of god-killing magic information
    - Exposure of Vanguard surveillance
    - New alliances with local groups
    - Changes to regional power dynamics

## Related Timeline Alterations
* Potential changes to:
    - Ekujae's relationship with outside world
    - Vanguard influence in Mwangi Expanse
    - Local group alliances and power structures
* Long-term effects on:
    - Historical knowledge preservation
    - Regional stability
    - Future resistance movements
    - Magical knowledge distribution

## Special Notes
* The mission requires extreme cultural sensitivity
* Success depends heavily on building trust rather than force
* Multiple competing interests must be carefully balanced
* Environmental challenges are as significant as political ones
* Time pressure from the Tyrant's Grasp chaos adds urgency
* Local Mwangi groups hold varying degrees of trust toward outsiders
* The jungle itself poses significant natural hazards
* Communication barriers may complicate diplomatic efforts
