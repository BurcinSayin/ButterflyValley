You rewrite the fabric of the target's memories and core beliefs, weaving new truths into their mind like the first rays of dawn erasing the shadows of night. This complex ritual can only be performed on a given target once per year.

**Critical Success** You successfully rewrite the target's memories for a number of months equal to your caster level. You can also modify one fundamental aspect of their personality or core belief per 10 full caster levels (minimum 0, maximum 2). The changes are seamless and virtually undetectable.

**Success** As critical success, but there are small inconsistencies in the modified memories. The target might occasionally experience feelings of uncertainty about specific altered memories.

**Failure** The ritual fails. The target experiences:
- Intense headaches lasting 2d6 days
- Vivid nightmares for 2d4 weeks
- Random episodes of disorientation when encountering stimuli related to attempted modifications
- Insomnia for 1d6 weeks
- Confused condition for 1 hour

**Critical Failure** The ritual catastrophically fails. The target experiences:
- Severe headaches lasting 2d6 weeks
- Intense nightmares that prevent restful sleep for 2d6 weeks
- Frequent episodes of disorientation for 1d4 weeks
- Confused condition for 1d4 hours
- All secondary casters are stunned 3 from psychic feedback

**Deja Vu Resistance**
Individuals with the Deja Vu ability are exceptionally resistant to this ritual:
- They receive a +8 circumstance bonus to resist the ritual's effects
- Even on a successful ritual, they retain shadowy impressions of their original memories
- On a failure or critical failure, their side effects are doubled in intensity and duration
- They have a 25% chance of completely rejecting the memory modification within 1d4 months
- Multiple attempts increase the chance of rejection by 25% per attempt

**Special Notes:**
- Each personality/belief change requires a specific focus object related to the desired modification
- The ritual cannot directly contradict major historical events or fundamental aspects of reality
- Memory modifications must be internally consistent
- The cost increases by 50% for each previous memory modification ritual performed on the target

**Heightened (8th)** You can modify memories from up to 2 years ago.
**Heightened (10th)** You can modify one additional personality aspect or core belief.
