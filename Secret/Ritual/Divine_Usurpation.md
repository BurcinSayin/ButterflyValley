## The Rite of Divine Usurpation
This ritual is the secret part of "The Ritual of Eternal Unity" it is performed under the cover of "The Ritual of Eternal Unity" and what actually gives selected Eternal Vanguard clergy to cast divine spells

### Components (in addition to the public components):
- A hidden receptacle containing the siphoned divine essence
- A specially prepared elixir infused with the siphoned power
- A set of mystical sigils carved into the altar, invisible to the uninitiated

### Ceremony (secret elements interwoven with the public ritual):
1. Before the initiate enters, the officiating High Inquisitor activates the hidden sigils on the altar, creating a subtle temporal distortion.
2. As the hymn is sung, the High Inquisitor mentally recites an occult incantation, preparing the siphoned divine essence.
3. When the initiate kneels, they unknowingly position themselves within the temporal distortion field.
4. The oath taken by the initiate serves as a verbal component of the secret ritual, binding them to the siphoned power.
5. The water in the chalice is actually the prepared elixir containing the siphoned divine essence.
6. As the initiate is anointed, the elixir creates a conduit for the divine power to enter their body.
7. The presented warhammer is imbued with a fraction of the siphoned power, serving as a focus for the initiate's new abilities.
8. The invocation by the Minister masks the true ritual being performed by the High Inquisitor, which channels the siphoned divine power into the initiate.
9. The communal meditation at the end serves to stabilize the newly granted powers and mask any visible signs of the transformation.

Outcomes:
- The initiate gains the ability to cast divine spells, believing it comes from the Vanguard's collective spiritual energy.
- The siphoned divine power is bound to the initiate, granting them abilities that align with the Vanguard's needs.
- The initiate remains unaware of the true source of their power, fully believing in the Vanguard's public doctrine.

This dual-nature ritual allows the Eternal Vanguard to maintain their public facade while secretly distributing the power gained through the Divine Power Siphon ritual. The ceremony's true nature remains hidden from the initiated and the public, known only to the highest ranks of the Vanguard.

### Special Note: Born Divine Casters

In rare cases, individuals may manifest the ability to cast what appear to be Eternal Vanguard divine spells without undergoing the Rite of Divine Usurpation. This phenomenon is attributed to four primary factors:

1. **Attunement to Living Gods:** Some individuals' personal beliefs and spiritual alignment are so strongly attuned to a still-living god that they naturally draw power from that deity. This connection allows them to cast divine spells that, on the surface, appear similar to those granted by the Vanguard.

2. **Resonance with Siphoned Divine Essence:** In other cases, an individual's personal beliefs and spiritual nature may closely align with a god whose power has been drained by the Divine Power Siphon ritual. This alignment creates a natural conduit for the flow of divine energy from the siphoned essence to the individual, bypassing the need for the formal ritual.

3. **Temporal Anomalies:** The Eternal Vanguard's extensive manipulation of time has created pockets of temporal instability throughout Golarion. Individuals born within or exposed to these anomalies may develop a unique connection to the divine power that transcends the normal flow of time. These casters might draw power from past or future versions of gods, or even from deities that no longer exist in the current timeline.

4. **Fragmentary Divine Essence:** The process of siphoning divine power is not perfect, and sometimes fragments of a god's essence escape during the ritual. These divine fragments may seek out individuals whose beliefs or actions align with the god's former portfolio. When such a fragment bonds with a mortal, it can grant them divine spellcasting abilities that mimic those of Vanguard clerics.

These spontaneous casters present both an opportunity and a challenge for the Eternal Vanguard:

- They are carefully monitored and often fast-tracked for important positions within the organization, as they represent a valuable resource of divine power.
- The Vanguard sees them as potential assets but also as potential threats, especially those connected to living gods or temporal anomalies.
- Their existence is kept strictly confidential. To the public and lower ranks, they are presented as prodigies specially blessed by the collective spirit of the Vanguard, maintaining the illusion of the Vanguard's divine mandate.
- The inner circle of the Vanguard dedicates significant resources to studying these individuals, hoping to better understand the nature of divine power and how to fully control or eliminate it.
- Cases involving temporal anomalies or fragmentary divine essence are of particular interest, as they challenge the Vanguard's understanding of their own powers and the nature of divinity itself.

The Eternal Vanguard's ultimate goal remains the complete eradication of all divine influence. However, the existence of these born casters serves as a reminder that the gods - both living and "defeated" - still hold some sway in the world, challenging the Vanguard's narrative of absolute control over divine power. Moreover, the cases involving temporal anomalies and divine fragments hint at the unforeseen consequences of the Vanguard's actions, potentially foreshadowing future complications in their grand plan.
