# Ritual: Temporal Jump (Modified)
**Rare Occult Ritual**
**Cast:** 1 day;
**Cost:** rare reagents worth 10,000gp; **Secondary Casters:** 3
**Primary Check:** Occultism (master); **Secondary Checks:** Arcana, Lore: Chronomancy
**Range:** 10 feet; **Target:** one to six willing creatures with the "Déjà Vu" ability
**Duration:** varies

This intricate ritual allows the casters to send one to six willing targets with the "Déjà Vu" ability backward in time. The ritual must be performed in a place isolated from the normal flow of time, such as the Bastion.

**Critical Success:** All targets arrive at the intended destination in the past without any ill effects, able to act immediately. When the duration ends or when the travelers enter the designated extraction point in the past, they return to the present at the ritual's casting location.

**Success:** The targets safely arrive at the destination time but are disoriented, taking 3d6 mental damage and becoming stunned 3. When the duration ends, they return to the designated extraction point, suffering the same effects.

**Failure:** The ritual fails to transport the targets through time. Any rare reagents are consumed. The targets suffer 6d6 mental damage and are stunned for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure:** The time travel goes disastrously wrong. The targets take 10d6 mental damage and vanish without a trace. The casters are unable to determine if the targets travelled to an alternate timeline, were erased from history, or met some other grim fate.

### Special:
- This ritual can only target living creatures with the "Déjà Vu" ability. Non-living materials and creatures without this ability cannot be affected. 
- The targets' unique connection to the timeline allows them to travel to any point in time, even before their birth or after their death. However, traveling to such extremes is incredibly taxing, causing an additional 2d6 mental damage upon arrival and return.
- During the ritual, the casters must designate an extraction point - a specific location in the past that, when entered by the travelers, will immediately end the ritual and return all targets to the present. This extraction point serves as an emergency exit, allowing travelers to return before the ritual's duration expires. The spatial coordinates of this point must be precisely defined during the casting.
- The duration of the travel is determined by the casters during the ritual. At the end of the duration, the targets automatically return to the designated extraction point.
- Traveling to the distant past or future is more taxing. For every century travelled, the targets take an additional 1d6 mental damage upon arrival and return.
- If the designated extraction point is compromised while the targets are in the past or future, their return point becomes a random location within 1 mile of the Bastion. 
- Paradoxes created by the targets' actions in the past or future are mitigated by the ritual's magic, causing history to "self-correct" in minor ways. However, major changes can still drastically alter or erase the present timeline.

### Temporal Flux Clauses:
1. **Temporal Echoes:** If a player is absent from a session, their character experiences a "temporal echo" effect. In the game world, the character appears to phase in and out of the timeline, becoming incorporeal and unable to interact with the physical world. This state persists until the player returns to the game, at which point their character fully reintegrates into the timeline.

2. **Temporal Displacement:** In cases where a character needs to be temporarily replaced, the ritual can "displace" the absent character and pull in another Butterfly Valley agent from a different point in the timeline. This replacement character joins the mission for its duration and returns to their original time upon completion.

3. **Chrono-Stalker Interference:** If a player must leave mid-mission, their character can be temporarily removed from the timeline due to interference from local Chrono-Stalkers. The character enters a state of temporal stasis until the player returns, at which point they rejoin the mission with no memory of the intervening events.

4. **Timeline Convergence:** For players joining an ongoing mission, the ritual can create a "convergence point" where their character's timeline intersects with the current mission. This allows new or returning players to seamlessly join the adventure in progress.

5. **Temporal Anchor:** Each character acts as a temporal anchor for the others. When the majority of travelers return to the present, any remaining travelers are automatically pulled back by the temporal anchor effect, regardless of their current situation or location in the past.
