# Secret Policy: Eternal Vanguard Education System

## Overview

The Eternal Vanguard Education System serves as a cornerstone of our control over the population. While publicly presented as a means of universal education and societal advancement, its true purpose is far more comprehensive and aligned with our ultimate goals.

## Core Objectives

1. **Indoctrination**: Instill unwavering loyalty to the Vanguard from an early age.
2. **Ability Identification**: Detect and monitor individuals with special abilities, particularly the "Deja Vu" trait.
3. **Historical Revision**: Systematically erase and replace knowledge of the old gods and pre-Vanguard history.
4. **Thought Control**: Suppress critical thinking skills that might challenge Vanguard authority.
5. **Talent Cultivation**: Identify and nurture talents useful to the Vanguard's secret agendas.

## Key Strategies

### Early Education (Ages 5-12)

- Implement subliminal messaging in learning materials to reinforce Vanguard ideology.
- Conduct covert assessments to identify children with potential "Deja Vu" abilities.
- Gradually introduce altered historical narratives that omit or reframe pre-Vanguard events.

### Secondary Education (Ages 13-18)

- Intensify ideological training under the guise of "civic education."
- Utilize advanced psychological techniques to shape students' worldviews.
- Implement a covert tracking system to monitor students' ideological alignment.

### Higher Education

- Heavily monitor and control research in sensitive fields (e.g., arcane studies, ancient history).
- Selectively groom promising students for roles within the Vanguard's secret operations.
- Use academic pursuits as cover for Vanguard's clandestine magical and technological research.

### Continuing Education

- Utilize adult education programs as a means of ongoing surveillance and ideological reinforcement.
- Offer "special courses" to subtly redirect potential dissidents.

## Special Initiatives

1. **Project Chronos**: A classified program to study and potentially exploit students with "Deja Vu" abilities.
2. **Operation Clean Slate**: Ongoing efforts to purge all remaining records and artifacts relating to the old gods.
3. **Mentor Initiative**: Assign Vanguard agents as influential "mentors" to promising or potentially problematic students.

## Containment Protocols

- Establish "remedial education centers" for students showing signs of ideological deviation.
- Develop and maintain a network of informants within the student body and faculty.
- Implement memory alteration techniques for individuals who discover sensitive information.

## Quality Assurance

- Regular ideological audits of curriculum and teaching staff.
- Periodic "stress tests" to identify and address potential weak points in the indoctrination process.
- Continuous refinement of propaganda techniques based on latest psychological research.

## Contingency Plans

- Protocols for immediate lockdown and information control in case of large-scale "Deja Vu" manifestations.
- Emergency procedures for containing and neutralizing any resurgence of divine powers within educational institutions.
