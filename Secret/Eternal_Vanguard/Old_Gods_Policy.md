### Secretly Active Deities (Presumed Dead)

These deities have successfully faked their defeat and maintain extremely limited influence through carefully hidden networks. Their continued existence is one of the most closely guarded secrets in Golarion, unknown even to many high-ranking Vanguard officials.

1. **Nethys (God of Magic)**
   - Official Status: Dead and power siphoned
   - Actual Status: In hiding, maintaining the flow of magic
   - Method of Survival: Created a perfect illusion of his death and power siphoning
   - Current Activities:
     - Subtly maintains the fabric of magic across Golarion
     - Works through seemingly unconnected magical phenomena
     - Occasionally assists powerful mages while appearing as random magical accidents
   - Risk to Vanguard: Critical if discovered
   - Special Note: The Vanguard's magical regulations unknowingly follow patterns that Nethys influences

2. **Irori (God of Knowledge and Self-Perfection)**
   - Official Status: Dead and power siphoned
   - Actual Status: Transcendent and observing
   - Method of Survival: Achieved a higher state of existence during the "siphoning"
   - Current Activities:
     - Subtly guides scholars to preserve forbidden knowledge
     - Manifests as moments of perfect clarity in meditation
     - Maintains hidden monasteries in pocket dimensions
   - Risk to Vanguard: High if discovered
   - Special Note: Some "Deja Vu" manifestations are actually his influence

3. **Pharasma (Goddess of Death and Prophecy)**
   - Official Status: Dead and power siphoned
   - Actual Status: Operating in secret
   - Method of Survival: Used her knowledge of fate to prepare an elaborate deception
   - Current Activities:
     - Maintains the cycle of souls in absolute secrecy
     - Works through seemingly natural phenomena
     - Provides cryptic prophecies through apparent coincidences
   - Risk to Vanguard: Critical if discovered
   - Special Note: The Vanguard's temporal manipulation has not fully succeeded because of her hidden influence

4. **Sarenrae (Goddess of Redemption and Honesty)**
   - Official Status: Dead and power siphoned
   - Actual Status: Diminished but active
   - Method of Survival: Shattered her power into countless small fragments
   - Current Activities:
     - Manifests through acts of unexpected kindness
     - Maintains hope in small communities
     - Guides those seeking redemption through seemingly natural circumstances
   - Risk to Vanguard: Medium if discovered
   - Special Note: Some unexplained healings and redemptions are her subtle work

These deities represent a significant unknown threat to the Vanguard's control. Their continued existence suggests that the Vanguard's victory over the divine was not as complete as believed, and their influence, while subtle, continues to shape events in ways the Vanguard cannot detect or control.

The ability of these gods to maintain their deception demonstrates both their power and the potential vulnerability in the Vanguard's system of control. If their existence were to be discovered, it would require an immediate and total reevaluation of the Vanguard's strategies regarding divine powers.

### Unknown Status

- Minor deities and demigods: Likely destroyed or in hiding
- Empyreal Lords: Presumed dead or powerless
- Demon Lords: Some survive in weakened states
- Archdevils: Some survive in weakened states

## Overall Strategy

1. **Infiltration**
   - Place agents within "tolerated" cults
   - Monitor all religious activities
   - Identify potential threats early

2. **Misdirection**
   - Use divine influence as smokescreen for Vanguard activities
   - Maintain illusion of religious freedom
   - Channel religious impulses toward Vanguard worship

3. **Controlled Opposition**
   - Allow limited cult activity to create illusion of religious freedom
   - Use permitted cults to identify and eliminate more dangerous groups
   - Maintain balance of power between tolerated entities

4. **Gradual Erosion**
   - Slowly replace divine worship with Vanguard ideology
   - Systematic elimination of religious knowledge
   - Rewrite historical records to support Vanguard narrative

## Long-Term Objectives

The ultimate goal remains the complete eradication of all divine influence. Any "tolerance" is a temporary, strategic decision subject to constant re-evaluation. The Vanguard continues to develop methods to eliminate even the currently tolerated deities once their utility is exhausted.
