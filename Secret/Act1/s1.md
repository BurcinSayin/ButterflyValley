# Abandoned Ritual Caves
## Session Overview

### Location
Small rocky island, 350 miles west of Unity Island in the Inner Sea. The island is roughly circular, about half a mile in diameter, with steep cliffs on all sides except for a small beach on the eastern shore.

### Background (For GM)
This facility was used by the Eternal Vanguard between -100 BV and -50 BV for conducting early temporal manipulation experiments. The site was abandoned after a catastrophic accident during a ritual, which caused parts of the complex to collapse. Unknown to the Vanguard, their repeated temporal experiments created a weak point in reality, which Butterfly Valley has managed to exploit to create a temporary gateway.

### Adventure Hook
The players, all having the Deja Vu ability, have been experiencing vivid dreams of this island for the past week. In these dreams, they see a butterfly made of silver light leading them through ancient stone corridors.
