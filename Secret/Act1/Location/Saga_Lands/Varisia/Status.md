# History
A strategically important region would be a priority target for the Eternal Vanguard.

1. Early Conquest (around -3500 AR to -3000 AR):
During the "Golden Age of the Vanguard" they would likely begin their conquest of Varisia. This aligns with their growing power and influence across the Inner Sea region.

2. Methods of Conquest:
- Military force against major population centers and Shoanti strongholds
- Infiltration and manipulation of Varisian nomadic groups
- Exploitation of rivalries between city-states like Magnimar and Korvosa

3. Suppression of Local Cultures (-3000 AR to 1 AR):
- Forced resettlement of Shoanti tribes, pushing them into less fertile lands
- Strict regulations on Varisian movement and cultural practices
- Destruction or repurposing of temples and holy sites, especially those dedicated to Desna

4. Resource Exploitation:
- Intensive mining operations in the Cinderlands and Storval Plateau
- Logging in the Churlwood and Lurkwood
- Establishment of Vanguard research outposts near major Thassilonian ruins

5. Ideological Reprogramming:
- Establishment of "re-education centers" in major cities
- Forced adoption of Vanguard ideology in schools and public institutions
- Suppression of traditional stories, songs, and divination practices

6. Covert Magical Research:
- Secret facilities for studying Thassilonian magic and artifacts
- Experiments on local populations to understand and replicate Thassilonian runelords' powers

7. Resistance and Its Suppression:
- Any organized resistance would be met with overwhelming force
- Use of time manipulation to prevent or undo major uprising attempts
- Deliberate fracturing of ethnic and cultural groups to prevent unified opposition

8. Public Narrative vs. Reality:
- While these oppressive measures were being implemented, the public narrative would paint a picture of peaceful integration and cultural preservation
- Historical records would be altered to downplay or erase evidence of resistance and ethnic cleansing

9. Pre-Triumph Consolidation:
By the time of the Triumph of the Vanguard (1 AR), Varisia would already be firmly under Vanguard control, its resources and magical knowledge being fully exploited to support the Vanguard's final push against the gods.

# Governance Policy
## Public Perception:

1. Integrated Province: Varisia would be presented as a fully integrated and thriving province within the Vanguard's domain, celebrated for its diverse landscapes and rich cultural heritage.

2. Economic Development: The Vanguard would likely promote significant infrastructure projects, particularly in urban centers like Magnimar and Korvosa, presenting this as economic progress for the region.

3. Cultural Preservation: There would be public initiatives to preserve and showcase Varisian culture, perhaps through museums, cultural centers, and festivals, all carefully curated by the Vanguard.

4. Thassilonian Research: The Vanguard might sponsor "archaeological research" into Thassilonian ruins, framing it as an effort to understand and preserve ancient history.

5. Natural Resource Management: Programs for sustainable management of Varisia's diverse ecosystems would be highlighted, emphasizing the Vanguard's commitment to environmental stewardship.

## Secret Reality:

1. Strategic Importance: Given Varisia's rich magical history, particularly its Thassilonian legacy, the Vanguard would view this region as critically important for their arcane research and time manipulation goals.

2. Thassilonian Exploitation: In secret, the Vanguard would be intensively studying and exploiting Thassilonian ruins and artifacts, seeking to harness their power for their own temporal manipulation abilities.

3. Suppression of Indigenous Practices: Traditional Varisian practices, especially those related to divination and worship of Desna, would be systematically suppressed and replaced with Vanguard ideology.

4. Shoanti Containment: The Shoanti people would likely be confined to designated areas, their warrior culture seen as a potential threat to Vanguard control.

5. Magical Monitoring: Given the region's magical significance, the Vanguard would implement extensive magical surveillance systems, particularly around sites of arcane importance.

6. Resource Exploitation: Varisia's natural resources, including its ores and timber, would be heavily exploited to fuel the Vanguard's projects, despite public claims of sustainability.

7. Population Control: Strict measures would be in place to control population movement, especially around sensitive areas like Thassilonian ruins or the Storval Plateau.

8. Indoctrination Centers: Major cities like Magnimar and Korvosa would host intensive indoctrination programs, aimed at erasing old loyalties and instilling devotion to the Vanguard.

9. Covert Operations: The region would likely be a hotbed of secret Vanguard activities, including experiments with time manipulation and the study of individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability.

10. Neutralization of Potential Threats: Any groups or individuals seen as potential threats, such as remnants of the Pathfinder Society or practitioners of old magic, would be covertly neutralized or co-opted.
***
In essence, while Varisia would be publicly portrayed as a valued and well-managed province, it would secretly be one of the most tightly controlled and extensively exploited regions under Vanguard rule. Its unique magical heritage and diverse population would make it both a treasure trove of arcane knowledge and a potential hotbed of resistance, requiring constant vigilance and manipulation from the Vanguard's secret operatives.
