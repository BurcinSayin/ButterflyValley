# Yvuvho Prison - Vanguard City High Security Facility

## Overview
Yvuvho Prison is a high-security facility designed to house the most dangerous and politically sensitive prisoners in the Eternal Vanguard's domain. It serves as both a detention center and a covert research facility.

## Location
Yvuvho Prison is situated in a remote area on the outskirts of the mountains north of Vanguard City. This isolated location provides natural barriers and makes escape attempts or unauthorized access extremely difficult. The mountainous terrain also offers convenient cover for the prison's more clandestine operations.

## Physical Description
- Imposing concrete and stone structure built into the mountainside
- Multiple security checkpoints leveraging both the natural terrain and constructed fortifications
- High walls with watchtowers overlooking the surrounding mountainous landscape
- Limited access roads, heavily patrolled and monitored

This high-security facility serves as a cornerstone of the Eternal Vanguard's justice system, embodying both its public face of law and order and its hidden agendas of control and experimentation. The presence of political prisoners and secret operations like Star Stone mining and Deja Vu experiments highlight the complex and often controversial nature of the Vanguard's rule.
