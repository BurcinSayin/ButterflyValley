# FREEDOM TOWN
*CN small town*

## HISTORY
Freedom Town was founded by criminal organization known as the Sharpes Gang in 4694 AR,2 as they fled north to escape justice in Lastwall. They found rich, tillable land which had been abandoned long ago to the orcs of Belkzen, and decided to set up a base there. Over the past two decades, Freedom Town has grown into a small community of all those needing to evade the law and willing to make a hard life among the dangers of the region. Tribute is regularly paid in food, gold, and persons to the local orc tribes and the government in Vigil has so far turned a blind eye to the problem, figuring that the hordes of Belkzen will surely alleviate them of this problem soon

## DESCRIPTION
Freedom Town consists of a small palisade-encircled wooden fort surrounded by poorly constructed wooden dwellings along the banks of the Aren River. The town is built primarily of wood, with most structures being simple and utilitarian. Its inhabitants are mainly outlaws, exiles, and escaped slaves who wish to be left alone—including a fair number of orcs and half-orcs who have left their tribes.

## GOVERNMENT
The only three surviving members of the Sharpes Gang make up Freedom Town's governing tribunal. The council's mandate is rather limited and consists of collecting taxes from everyone living or doing business in town in order to pay Grask Uldeth's tribute. Anyone incapable of paying this levy—or anyone who annoys the tribunal—is offered up as payment instead.

The council consists of:
* Garrick Bitune, an aging bard who during his youth used to get by on his good looks
* Helmut Drovenge, the black sheep of a prominent Chelish family
* Marguerite Ollande, the only council member who still sees Freedom Town as a shining ideal of entrepreneurial spirit

## POWER STRUCTURE
The only other major power in town is the Union of the Open Palm, a cult of the archdevil Mammon that is rapidly growing in power. The cult is led by Voice in Silver Marotis, a well-spoken man who moved to town a few years ago offering low-interest loans, but who now has caught a sizable majority of Freedom Town's citizens in a debt-spiral from which they can't escape.
