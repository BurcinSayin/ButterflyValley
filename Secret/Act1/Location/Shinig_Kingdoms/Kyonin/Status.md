1. When would Kyonin fall under Eternal Vanguard rule?

Given the timeline, it's most likely that Kyonin would fall under Vanguard control during the period known as "The Triumph of the Vanguard" (1 AR) or shortly thereafter. Here's why:

- The Vanguard defeated a coalition of gods and their followers around this time.
- Elves, being long-lived and deeply connected to their deities, would likely have been part of this resistance.
- The fall of the gods would have significantly weakened Kyonin's ability to resist the Vanguard.

So, a reasonable estimate would be that Kyonin fell under Vanguard control between 1 AR and 50 AR.

2. How would Kyonin fall under Eternal Vanguard rule?

The fall of Kyonin to the Eternal Vanguard would likely involve a combination of factors:

a) Divine Abandonment: With the defeat of the elven deities, particularly Desna and Calistria, the elves of Kyonin would have lost a significant source of their power and guidance.

b) Temporal Manipulation: The Vanguard's ability to manipulate time could have been used to undermine Kyonin's defenses, perhaps by altering key moments in elven history.

c) Diplomatic Pressure: The Vanguard might have offered the elves a choice between peaceful integration or forceful subjugation, presenting their rule as inevitable.

d) Internal Division: Some elven factions, seeing the Vanguard's victory as unavoidable, might have advocated for cooperation to preserve what they could of their culture.

e) Gradual Encroachment: Rather than a sudden conquest, the Vanguard might have slowly expanded their influence in Kyonin, establishing outposts and gaining supporters over time.

f) Environmental Manipulation: Given the elves' connection to nature, the Vanguard might have used their power to affect the Fierani Forest, forcing the elves to seek their aid.

The eventual establishment of Iadara's Refuge as a "sanctuary" for elven culture under Vanguard rule suggests that the transition, while ultimately a conquest, might have involved some level of negotiation or compromise to preserve aspects of elven society.

This combination of factors would have led to Kyonin's incorporation into the Eternal Vanguard's domain, transforming the once-independent elven kingdom into a controlled region, with Iadara's Refuge serving as a symbol of both preservation and subjugation of elven culture.
