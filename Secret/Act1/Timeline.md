This is an alternative timeline for Golarion in which Aroden was never born and the Eternal Vanguard filled the power vacuum. This is the main timeline change made by the Eternal Vanguard.

AR reference according to original Golarion Calendar before the time manipulation was made (Absalom Reckoning). Publicly it is used as "Before Vanguard" (BV) and "After Vanguard" (AV). -1 BV is equal to -1 AR and 1 AV is equal to 1 AR.

1. Earthfall (-5293 BV): The cataclysmic event occurs, plunging Golarion into the Age of Darkness.

2. Emergence of the Eternal Vanguard (-5000 BV): In the midst of the Age of Darkness, a small, secretive organization known as the Eternal Vanguard forms. They begin to study ancient magics and develop their time manipulation abilities.

3. Return of Sunlight (-4294 BV): The Age of Darkness ends as sunlight returns to Golarion. The Eternal Vanguard begins to emerge more publicly, offering aid to struggling societies.

4. The Quiet Century (-4200 to -4100 BV): The Eternal Vanguard works to consolidate its power and influence, using its time manipulation abilities to subtly alter events in its favor.

5. The Golden Age of the Vanguard (-3700 to -3200 BV): The Vanguard's influence grows significantly. Their public works and social welfare programs earn them great loyalty from the common people, while their secret magics allow them to outmaneuver any rivals.

6. The Gradual Decline (-3200 to -2000 BV): As millennia pass, the Eternal Vanguard begins to face challenges. Some of the gods and their followers grow suspicious of the Vanguard's true nature. Rival nations and factions start to emerge, challenging the Vanguard's hegemony.

7. The Time of Troubles (-1000 BV): Open conflict erupts between the Eternal Vanguard and a coalition of gods and their mortal followers. The start of a 1000-year-long ritual to destroy gods marks the beginning of this era.

8. The Triumph of the Vanguard (1 AV): After a long and terrible conflict, the Eternal Vanguard defeats the coalition of gods and their followers. Many of the gods are slain, their power broken forever with the completion of the 1000-year-long ritual.

9. Foundation of Vanguard City (1 AV): The Eternal Vanguard establishes a grand city on the Isle of Unity (known as the Isle of Kortos in the original timeline). This city, known as Vanguard City, becomes the new center of power for the Eternal Vanguard.

10. The Great Revision (1 to 100 AV): With their mastery of time magic, the Eternal Vanguard begins to rewrite history. They erase all traces of the gods' influence, altering memories and records to make it seem as if the gods never existed.

11. The Age of the Vanguard (100 to 1000 AV): Under the Vanguard's rule, Golarion enters a new era. The Vanguard's principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice become the governing ideology.

12. The Eradication of Magic (500 AV): To cement its power, the Eternal Vanguard begins a campaign to regulate all forms of magic. Arcane schools are brought under strict control, and practitioners of unapproved magic are persecuted.

13. The Era of Eternal Guidance (1000 to 3000 AV): As centuries pass, the Eternal Vanguard's rule becomes more entrenched and bureaucratic. The leadership of the Vanguard becomes a dynasty, with power passed down through generations of powerful families.

14. The Stagnant Era (3000 to 5000 AV): Under the Vanguard's absolute rule, Golarion settles into a state of stagnation. Society becomes rigidly structured and resistant to change.

15. The Temporal Crisis (5000 AV): The Eternal Vanguard's constant manipulation of time begins to take its toll on the fabric of reality. Strange temporal anomalies and paradoxes start to occur with increasing frequency. The Vanguard struggles to maintain control.

16. The Shattering of Time (5000 AR and beyond): In a cataclysmic event, the contradictions in Golarion's heavily revised timeline reach a breaking point. Time itself fractures, splitting into countless divergent realities. The Eternal Vanguard's rule ends in chaos, and Golarion is left a broken, divided world, its true history lost forever.
