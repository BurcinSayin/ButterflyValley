# Ritual Chamber

## Chamber Overview
A vast circular chamber, 60 feet in diameter, hewn from living rock. The walls are inscribed with silver runes that emit a faint, pulsing light. The air shimmers with temporal distortions, creating occasional ripples in reality.

## The Four Statues
Positioned at the cardinal points of the chamber stand four imposing statues, each 12 feet tall, carved from black stone veined with silver:

### North: Geb
- Depicted as a regal figure with a cracked crown
- Base inscription in ancient Osiriani: "Eternal Life Through Undeath"
- Missing right hand (important for puzzle mechanics)
- DC 15 Religion check reveals Geb's association with immortality and undeath

### East: Asmodeus
- Portrayed holding a ruby-tipped rod
- Base inscription in Infernal: "Power Through Order"
- Ruby in rod is actually a mechanism trigger
- DC 15 Religion check identifies Asmodeus's connections to tyranny and order

### South: Set
- Represented as a muscular figure with a beast's head
- Base inscription in Ancient Osiriani: "Strength Through Darkness"
- Holds a broken staff
- DC 15 Religion check reveals Set's dominion over darkness and storms

### West: Apep
- Depicted as a massive serpent coiled around a pillar
- Base inscription in Draconic: "Chaos Brings Renewal"
- Serpent's eyes were once gemstones (now empty sockets)
- DC 15 Religion check identifies Apep's role as a force of chaos and destruction

## Activation Sequence
1. Players must figure out why these specific deities were chosen (DC 16 Religion or DC 18 Vanguard Lore):
   - All four deities represent aspects of immortality or time manipulation
   - The Vanguard studied their powers while developing temporal magic

2. Puzzle Elements:
   - Each statue has a hidden mechanism
   - Requires understanding the Vanguard's interest in each deity's power
   - Wrong activation order summons a Chrono-Stalker

3. Correct Sequence:
   - Geb (Immortality) → Asmodeus (Order) → Apep (Chaos) → Set (Darkness)
   - Represents the Vanguard's path: achieve immortality, establish order, embrace chaos, emerge from darkness

Through endless life we seek to rise,\
By iron law our power lies,\
In serpent's coils truth applies,\
From shadow's heart our strength shall rise.

## Chamber Features

3. Deja Vu Insights:
   - Players with high Wisdom might get flashes of past activations
   - Temporal distortions react to correct choices

## Success
