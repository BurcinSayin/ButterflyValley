## Tyrant's Grasp

1. Escape from Containment (15th Freedomrise, 4719 AV):
   Temporal anomalies caused by the Vanguard's extensive time manipulation weaken the Whispering Tyrant's prison. Exploiting this weakness, Tar-Baphon escapes from his containment facility in Ustalav.

2. The Radiant Fire (1st Welfaretide, 4719 AV):
   The complacent Eternal Vanguard, believing all major threats neutralized, fails to prevent Tar-Baphon from unleashing the Radiant Fire. This devastating magical effect destroys large portions of Ustalav and parts of neighboring Vanguard-controlled territories.

3. Fall of the Ustalavic Administrative Zone (5th-10th Welfaretide, 4719 AV):
   The Vanguard-controlled region of Ustalav, long dedicated to containing the Whispering Tyrant, is essentially destroyed. Many of its people are killed or turned into undead, creating a significant crisis for the Vanguard.

4. Creation of the Deadlands (15th Welfaretide, 4719 AV):
   The devastated areas become known as the Deadlands, a blighted region under the Whispering Tyrant's control. The Vanguard struggles to contain and reclaim this area.

5. Tyrant's Magical Breakthrough (1st Justiceflow, 4719 AV):
   Tar-Baphon discovers a method to bypass Vanguard magical defenses by tapping into the scattered essences of dead gods, greatly enhancing his power and threat level.

6. Formation of the Shadow Alliance (15th Justiceflow - 30th Laborshine, 4719 AV):
   The Whispering Tyrant forms a secret alliance with other powerful entities opposed to the Vanguard, including remnants of old gods and ancient beings who have survived in hiding.

7. Global Chaos (1st Wealthgrow - 30th Unityfall, 4719 AV):
   The Shadow Alliance orchestrates multiple simultaneous uprisings and catastrophes across Golarion, forcing the Vanguard to spread their resources thin and creating widespread panic.

8. Battle of Vanguard City (1st Wisdomshadow - 15th Wisdomshadow, 4720 AV):
   Taking advantage of the chaos and the Vanguard's divided attention, the Whispering Tyrant leads a massive assault on Vanguard City. The battle is fierce, with the Tyrant's forces breaching the city's outer defenses.

9. Vanguard's Desperate Counter (15th Wisdomshadow - 30th Wisdomshadow, 4720 AV):
   The Eternal Vanguard, facing their greatest crisis, mobilizes all available resources to defend their capital. They may resort to desperate measures, possibly even attempting large-scale time manipulation to turn the tide.

10. Aftermath (1st Futureship, 4720 AV onwards):
    The events of this alternate Tyrant's Grasp reshape the political landscape of Golarion, severely weakening the Vanguard's image of invincibility. It leads to increased unrest in Vanguard-controlled territories and potentially awakens more individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability as reality fluctuates under the strain of conflict.
