## Current Situation
The team is helping with preparations for the Swallowtail Festival, unaware of the impending goblin raid. They plan to participate in the festival's opening ceremonies and help with security during the celebrations.

## Distinctive Equipment
- Each member wears a silver pin shaped like a rising sun (their team symbol)
- Thane's dwarven-crafted armor
- Selene's collection of ancient texts and research materials
- Raven's masterwork longbow
- Lyra's ceremonial Vanguard robes for special occasions

## Future Plans (Never to Be Realized)
- Starting a formal training program for town guards
- Expanding their patrols to cover more of the Lost Coast
- Establishing a permanent base of operations in Sandpoint
- Creating a proper militia to support the town guard

Note: The team's strong connections to the community and their plans for Sandpoint's future make their potential loss during the goblin raid particularly tragic. Their absence would leave a noticeable void in the town's defenses and daily life, potentially motivating players to take up their mantle as protectors of Sandpoint.
