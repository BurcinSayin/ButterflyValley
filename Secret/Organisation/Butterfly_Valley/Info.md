# Butterfly Valley

## Founding
Butterfly Valley was founded by Ariadne Timeweaver, Zephyr Vialwright and Eoghan Moonseer in response to their visions of a dystopian future ruled by a time manipulating organisation. Realizing the immense threat posed by a possible organization with the ability to manipulate the timeline, these three visionaries created Butterfly Valley as a bastion of hope and resistance against those who would abuse the power of time manipulation.

## Headquarters
To protect itself from the temporal machinations of "The Eternal Vanguard", Butterfly Valley established its headquarters on a unique demi-plane, isolated from all timelines. This plane, known as the Bastion, exists outside the normal flow of time. Anyone who enters the Bastion is effectively removed from their original timeline.

### The Bastion's Geography
The Bastion consists of a large, habitable island surrounded by imposing mountain ranges. The landmass contains all necessary natural resources to sustain life:

- Numerous freshwater springs, rivers, and lakes
- Rich, fertile valleys perfect for farming
- Dense forests providing timber and game
- Abundant mineral deposits in the mountains
- Natural cavern systems throughout the ranges
- Rolling hills and meadows for grazing livestock

While there is no sun, the demiplane experiences regular 12-hour cycles of brightening and dimming, providing a day/night rhythm for inhabitants. The source of this illumination appears to be the demiplane itself, creating a diffuse light that permeates the atmosphere. The climate remains temperate year-round, making it ideal for agriculture and comfortable living.

### Life in the Bastion
The Bastion is more than just a headquarters - it's a fully-functioning society, with all the necessary resources and infrastructure to support its inhabitants indefinitely. 

- **Agriculture**: Vast farmlands in the fertile valleys produce grains, vegetables, and fruits. Orchards dot the gentler slopes, while livestock grazes in the meadows. Traditional farming methods, enriched by generations of experience, ensure bountiful harvests.

- **Water**: The demi-plane's natural water cycle provides abundant fresh water through springs, rivers, and lakes. Water wheels harness the power of flowing rivers for mills and other necessary machinery.

- **Resources**: The forests provide timber for construction and firewood, while quarries in the mountains yield stone for building. Traditional crafts flourish, from blacksmithing to woodworking, supporting the community's needs.

- **Settlements**: The inhabitants live in well-built homes of stone and wood, constructed to last generations. Communities are typically built near water sources and farming areas, with defensive positions in the higher ground.

- **Recreation**: Gardens, communal gathering spaces, and natural areas provide places for relaxation and community activities. Libraries preserve knowledge, while training grounds prepare new members for their duties.

- **Education**: Traditional schools teach both practical skills and academic knowledge, while specialized training prepares members for their roles in protecting the timeline.

- **Healing**: Skilled healers maintain infirmaries stocked with herbs and natural remedies, tending to the community's health needs through traditional medicine and magical healing.

### Natural Hazards and Predators
While the Bastion is designed to be a safe haven, it is not without its dangers. The unique nature of the demi-plane gives rise to several natural hazards and predators that the inhabitants must contend with.

- **Temporal Storms**: Occasionally, the Bastion is struck by violent temporal storms. These chaotic events can cause localized time distortions, rapidly aging or de-aging anything caught in their path. The Resistance has developed early warning systems and sturdy shelters to protect the population during these storms.

- **Chrono-Beasts**: The Bastion is home to several species of exotic, time-sensitive creatures known as Chrono-Beasts. These animals have evolved to navigate the temporal inconsistencies of the demi-plane, and some of them, like the Swift-Stalkers and the Temporal Raptors, are dangerous predators. The Resistance trains specialized teams to monitor and manage the Chrono-Beast populations, ensuring they don't pose a significant threat to the settlements.

- **Time-Warped Terrain**: In certain areas of the Bastion, the fabric of time is particularly unstable, leading to bizarre, ever-shifting landscapes. These Time-Warped Terrains can be treacherous to navigate, with sudden temporal shifts causing the ground to fluctuate between different eras. Explorers and resource gatherers are trained to recognize and avoid these hazardous zones.

Despite these challenges, the inhabitants of the Bastion have adapted to live in harmony with their unique environment. Butterfly Valley uses the knowledge gained from studying these phenomena to better understand the nature of time and to develop new strategies for combating "The Eternal Vanguard".

## Recruitment
Butterfly Valley actively seeks out individuals who possess the rare "Deja Vu" ability - the innate sense that they have lived through certain events before. These "Deja Vu Children" are crucial to the organization's plans, as their unique temporal perception allows them to operate effectively in the face of "The Eternal Vanguard's" time manipulation.

Recruits who do not possess the "Deja Vu" ability are still valuable to the cause, but they face a significant limitation. Once they enter the Bastion, they are permanently removed from their original timeline. They cease to exist in any other place or time, and are therefore unable to leave the Bastion without risking paradoxes or erasure from existence.

## The Temporal Jump Ritual
The key to Butterfly Valley's strategy is the Temporal Jump ritual. This complex arcane procedure allows the organization to project its agents into carefully selected points in the timeline, where they can work to counter the actions of "The Eternal Vanguard".

The ritual is highly precise, allowing for jumps to specific moments with minimal risk of paradoxes or unintended consequences. However, it requires immense amounts of energy and can only be performed from the safety of the Bastion.

## Dormancy and Activation
To avoid detection and preserve its resources, Butterfly Valley remains largely dormant, its agents living quiet lives in the Bastion. The organization only activates when the "Deja Vu Children" begin to emerge, signaling that "The Eternal Vanguard" is on the move.

Once activated, the Resistance begins deploying agents through the Temporal Jump ritual, engaging in a secret war across time to preserve the integrity of the timeline and prevent "The Eternal Vanguard" from reshaping history to their own ends.
