## Public Agenda
The Eternal Vanguard presents itself as a religion dedicated to the upliftment and empowerment of all people. It emphasizes the importance of hard work, justice, and the well-being of society. Followers are encouraged to contribute to their communities, support social welfare programs, and fight against oppression. They believe that through diligence and cooperation, a utopian society can be achieved where everyone is free to pursue their dreams.

## Secret Agenda
Unbeknownst to the general public and rank-and-file members, the Eternal Vanguard's true goal is to eradicate all gods on Golarion and free the world from divine influence. The inner circle, led by the enigmatic **High Chronomancer**, possesses ancient time-manipulation magic known as "Temporal Regression," which they use to subtly alter events and consolidate their power.

The High Chronomancer, through a forbidden ritual, can siphon a portion of a dead god's power and influence. This stolen divine essence is then used to grant divine spells and powers to the Vanguard's true believers and high-ranking members, furthering their loyalty and devotion to the cause.

## Public Practices
- Community Service: Followers regularly engage in public works, building infrastructure, providing aid to the needy, and organizing educational programs.
- Rituals of Labor: Ceremonies celebrating the dignity of work and the unity of the community are held frequently.  
- Festivals of Freedom: Annual celebrations where the successes of the community are honored, and the ideals of freedom and justice are reinforced through parades, speeches, and communal feasts.

## Secret Practices
- Time Manipulation: The inner circle conducts clandestine rituals to manipulate the flow of time, subtly altering events to their advantage and undermining the influence of the gods.
- Harvesting Divine Power: When a god dies, the High Chronomancer performs a secret ritual to siphon a portion of the dead deity's power, which is then distributed among the Vanguard's elite.
- Infiltration and Sabotage: Vanguard agents infiltrate rival religious organizations and nations, gathering intelligence and sowing discord to weaken their opposition.

## Public Leadership and Hierarchy
- Grand Arbiter: The supreme leader who guides the overall vision and strategy of the religion. They are seen as the embodiment of the Vanguard's principles.
- Council of Stewards: Senior leaders elected by the clergy and followers. They govern the daily operations of the religion across different regions.
- Regional Advocates: Each region or major city has a Regional Advocate who oversees the religion's activities in that area. 
- Wardens of the People: Dedicated leaders who manage local chapters or congregations. They are the direct point of contact for most followers.
- Justiciars: Appointed to ensure the principles of justice and fairness are upheld within the Vanguard's operations.
- Acolytes and Advocates: Entry-level followers who are actively involved in the daily activities and rituals. Advocates are experienced members with additional responsibilities. 

## Secret Leadership and Hierarchy
- High Chronomancer: The true leader of the Eternal Vanguard, possessing the power of Temporal Regression and overseeing the secret agenda of eradicating the gods.
- Council of Shadows: A select group of powerful Chronomancers and trusted agents who lead the Vanguard's covert operations and maintain the facade of the public religion.
- Tempus Inquisitors: Elite agents trained in both divine magic and chronomancy, tasked with hunting down threats to the Vanguard and protecting its secrets at all costs.

## Role in Golarion
The Eternal Vanguard operates primarily in urban centers, where it can easily blend its public works with its clandestine activities. Its followers are drawn mainly from the working and middle classes, attracted by its message of social justice and self-improvement. 

Behind this benevolent facade, the Vanguard's inner circle works tirelessly to unravel the power of the gods, manipulating time and harvesting divine power to further their ultimate goal of a world free from divine influence, where the Vanguard reigns supreme.

I understand you'd like me to create a new section for the "Secret_Religion_Eternal_Vanguard" document, focusing on Clerics. I'll add this section, keeping in mind the distinction between public knowledge and secret information. Here's the new section:

## Clerics

### Public Knowledge
The Eternal Vanguard teaches that the combined goodwill and faith of all believers generates a powerful spiritual energy. This collective force is what grants clerics and other divine practitioners their abilities. The Vanguard emphasizes that this power comes from the unity and shared purpose of its followers, rather than from external divine entities.

Clerics of the Eternal Vanguard are seen as conduits for this collective spiritual energy. They are revered as individuals who have honed their minds and spirits to channel the combined faith of the people into tangible effects that benefit society. Their ability to heal, protect, and guide is presented as a manifestation of the Vanguard's principles of social welfare and community support.

### Secret Truth
In reality, the divine powers wielded by the clerics of the Eternal Vanguard come from a much darker source. The inner circle of the Vanguard, led by the enigmatic High Chronomancer, has developed a blasphemous ritual known as the Divine Power Siphon. This ritual allows them to harvest the residual power of dead or severely weakened gods.

The Eternal Vanguard has been systematically hunting down and eliminating the gods of Golarion, using their sophisticated time manipulation abilities to overcome even these mighty beings. After a deity is slain or sufficiently weakened, the High Chronomancer performs the Divine Power Siphon ritual to capture a portion of the god's fading essence.

This stolen divine energy is then carefully distributed among the Vanguard's most loyal clerics and other divine spellcasters. The powers granted often align thematically with the domains of the fallen deity, though this connection is carefully obscured to prevent suspicion.

The clerics themselves are unaware of the true source of their power. They genuinely believe in the Vanguard's teachings about collective spiritual energy. This ignorance serves as an additional layer of protection for the Vanguard's secrets, as even magical attempts to discern the truth from these clerics will fail.

The inner circle of the Eternal Vanguard sees this use of harvested divine power as the ultimate victory over the gods - not only have they been defeated, but their very essence is now being used to further the Vanguard's goals. However, this practice is not without risk. The stolen divine power is finite, and as it dwindles, the Vanguard must continually seek out new divine sources to maintain their clerics' abilities and their façade of spiritual authority.
