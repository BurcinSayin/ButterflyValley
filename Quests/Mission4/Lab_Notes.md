# Researcher's Journal: Starstone Applications in Undead Control
*Laboratory Notes of Senior Alchemist Valeria Marwick*

## Entry 1: Project "Eternal Hope" Begins (12 Progressflame, 3825)
Command has finally approved full-scale experimentation on Starstone dust applications for Project Eternal Hope. The specimens arrived today—twelve undead of varying intelligence levels, primarily revenants and higher-order corporeal undead who've retained cognitive functions. After years of studying necromantic energies to find their ultimate weakness, this opportunity to work with such diverse specimens might finally yield the breakthrough we need to permanently counter undead threats.

The current Starstone dust samples, while promising, still don't yield the energy signatures I've hypothesized should be present. I suspect we need more refined processing methods to properly release the unique energies. I've requested specialized milling equipment from Central Supply to test my theory of micro-granulation. Director Valentin seemed skeptical but approved the requisition nevertheless. It's frustrating working only with dust samples - I've heard rumors of larger fragments, but either they no longer exist or I lack sufficient clearance to access them.

*Personal Note: What IS the connection between Starstone and undead tissue? The initial reactions are fascinating—almost as if the particles are attempting to "recognize" something in the necrotic matter. If we can understand this interaction, we might finally develop a universal countermeasure against all undead, not just specific types. The devastation I witnessed in my hometown during the Shining Crusade cannot be allowed to happen again.*

## Entry 2: First Control Trials (25 Progressflame, 3825)
Applied standard necromantic control vectors to our first test subjects today, but introduced Starstone particles to the binding runes. Results are genuinely promising but wildly unpredictable! Subject 3, a particularly willful revenant, demonstrated unprecedented response to control stimuli after infusion. Resistance to command dropped by approximately 65%, though the subject exhibited unusual sensitivity to our control methods.

The most intriguing part was the subject's cognitive response—it maintained higher reasoning functions while under control, something typically lost during standard necromantic domination. This suggests the Starstone creates a fundamentally different type of control mechanism.

*Personal Note: The magical aura readings when Subject 3 received commands were unlike anything in our reference materials. Is this truly just enhanced necromancy, or are we seeing something entirely new? The luminescence patterns in the binding runes suggest a completely novel form of energy transfer.*

## Entry 3: Divine Spark Confirmation (8 Unityfall, 3825)
EUREKA! CONFIRMATION AT LAST! Subject 7's third infusion cycle produced measurable divine resonance patterns! The fine-milled Starstone dust (at 1/100th standard particle size) yielded energy signatures matching ancient theorems of divine conduit mechanics!

The implications are staggering. The residual energy within these Starstone fragments creates a form of "control matrix" throughout necrotic tissue that is fundamentally different from standard necromancy. While necromantic control suppresses consciousness, this method seems to impose a form of "obligation binding" while preserving cognitive function. Subject 7 now responds to commands with near-perfect compliance while maintaining reasoning capabilities.

*Personal Note: Divine energy controlling undead seems counterintuitive, given traditional theories about positive/negative energy interactions. Is this why standard-size Starstone fragments destroy undead on contact? The micro-granulation must alter the energy dispersal pattern somehow. If we can perfect this control mechanism, we could potentially command undead armies to march themselves into containment zones, or even self-destruct. Finally, a true solution to the undead plague that has haunted humanity since the Age of Darkness.*

## Entry 4: Setback (21 Wisdomshadow, 3825)
Lost Subject 4 today during advanced binding procedures. Devastating loss of data. Subject's form destabilized completely when the divine resonance overwhelmed the negative energy maintaining its undead state. This suggests a crucial balance must be maintained—too much divine exposure destroys the very subjects we're attempting to control.

Post-disintegration analysis revealed curious crystalline structures at the failure points—fragments of Starstone that had completely merged with the necrotic tissue before causing catastrophic failure. The divine spark appears to have "recognized" and rejected the undead state.

*Personal Note: The crystallization patterns at the failure points are remarkably similar to depictions of divine manifestation in pre-Vanguard religious texts I studied for comparative research. Could these energy signatures be related to whatever powered the old "gods"? Pure scientific speculation, of course, but the pattern similarities are undeniable.*

## Entry 5: BREAKTHROUGH! (12 Futureship, 3826)
SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH! After months of trials, I've successfully developed a method for extracting divine essence directly from Starstone dust! By suspending micro-granulated particles in a solution of purified negative energy and subjecting them to alternating arcane frequencies, the particles release their divine energy without destabilizing!

This extracted essence retains all the properties needed for our control matrices but can be applied with unprecedented precision. The potential applications extend far beyond our current project parameters. I've submitted a full report to Director Valentin with a request to expand our research scope.

*Personal Question: What other applications might this extraction method have? The control matrices work on undead tissue, but would living subjects respond similarly? The ethical implications are concerning, but the scientific questions are irresistible.*

## Entry 6: Crusade Conclusion (15 Triumphcrest, 3827)
The Shining Crusade is officially ending. Director Valentin has informed us that our project is now entering its most critical phase. With the crusade's conclusion, we're receiving significantly more resources and a mandate to accelerate our research. The extraction method I developed last year has been designated "high priority" with unexpected attention from Vanguard City itself.

I've requested additional specimens with higher cognitive function to test more complex command structures. If we can successfully bind and control such subjects using the extracted divine essence, we'll have exceeded all initial projections. The supply of Starstone dust has been more than doubled, though I'm concerned about storage safety given the unusual properties we've observed.

*Personal Note: The increased attention from Vanguard City is both exciting and somewhat unsettling. Why the sudden urgency? Director Valentin mentioned potential "field applications" today—what exactly does that mean in the context of this research?*

## Entry 7: Unexpected Visitor (19 Triumphcrest, 3827)
Concerning reports from the surface today. A Knight-Commander named Iomedae arrived at the outpost—a high-ranking officer based on the reaction of the security personnel. We've been instructed to secure all sensitive materials and halt external specimen transfers temporarily.

The most intriguing development: Divine essence that has been already extracted demonstrated unusual energy spikes during her visit, despite being 100 feet underground and supposedly warded! Could she somehow be resonating with the extracted divine essence? Is it possible some individuals naturally possess similar energy signatures?

*Personal Note: I've secretly gone to the surface from the extraction lab to sneak a peek to this Knight-Commander. There's something remarkable about her—a certain quality that's difficult to quantify. Her reputation for hunting down undead threats and corruption is legendary among the Crusade forces. The facility's reaction to her visit seems disproportionate for a routine inspection. Director Valentin appeared genuinely unsettled—I've never seen him react that way to any authority figure before. And why would her presence trigger our detection equipment? Something doesn't add up about this project's true purpose. I've always been told our research aims to neutralize undead threats, but the reaction to Iomedae's visit suggests something else might be happening here.*

## Entry 8: Increased Oversight (20 Wisdomshadow, 3827)
Our reporting schedule has intensified, with particular emphasis on documenting the relationship between the divine essence properties and our control mechanisms. The divine essence extraction procedures I developed are now under constant monitoring.

Subject 7 continues to demonstrate perfect compliance while retaining higher cognitive functions. However, we've noticed occasional behavioral anomalies—it sometimes anticipates commands before they're given. This warrants further study but doesn't appear to compromise the control matrix.

## Entry 9: Disturbing Developments (2 Freedomrise, 3828)

Subject 7 briefly escaped containment today. Three researchers were later found dead in the eastern clearing, with Subject 7 standing among the bodies when our security team arrived. Most disturbingly, Director Valentin prevented me from talking to or examining Subject 7 upon its recapture. He insisted on handling the situation himself, which immediately made me suspicious. The subject remained unresponsive and refused any interaction while Director Valentin was present. Subject 7 made no attempt to flee. When questioned (via magical means, presumably by the Director), it claimed to be "following instructions" despite no such commands being issued through official channels that I am aware of.

*Personal Note: My suspicions are growing stronger. The behavior of Subject 7 directly contradicts our control parameters, which should make leaving the base impossible. Director Valentin's interference with my examination of the subject only deepens my concern. Who issued these "instructions" it claims to have followed? I've gone back through Director Valentin's project documentation, and there are troubling inconsistencies. The original proposal described our work as developing countermeasures against undead threats, but the recent directives focus exclusively on control mechanics with no mention of neutralization. I fear our research is being directed toward purposes I never intended to support.*

## Entry 10: Divine Essence Properties (15 Dutyhold, 3828)
Further testing confirms my initial hypothesis: the Starstone's primary value lies in its divine essence. These fragments contain residual divine power that, when properly extracted and applied to undead subjects, creates a paradoxical effect: the undead become bound by divine compulsion while maintaining their unliving state.

This represents a revolutionary breakthrough in control mechanisms. Traditional necromancy relies on negative energy dominance, but our method establishes a form of divine obligation that the undead cannot resist without destroying themselves in the process.

*Personal Question: The divine essence extraction formula—the one I developed—is being applied to projects beyond our facility. I've overheard references to shipments and "specialized handlers." What are they using my discovery for? The applications for controlling undead are clear, but the energy patterns could theoretically be adapted for other purposes...*

## Final Entry: Unusual Activity (17 Dutyhold, 3828)
Something extraordinary is happening in the facility. Security forces are in constant motion, and Director Valentin has ordered emergency protocols. Most peculiar: a team of specialists arrived this morning wearing unusual Vanguard insignia I've never seen before.

The visitors requested access to all my research on divine essence extraction and conducted what appeared to be a thorough audit of our procedures. Their knowledge of my work was startlingly comprehensive, including details from experiments I conducted just yesterday! How could they possibly know?

Most alarming of all: the divine essence samples in storage are exhibiting unprecedented activity levels. The crystalline structures are growing at accelerated rates, and the energy signatures have begun pulsing in rhythmic patterns. It's almost as if they're responding to something—or someone—in the facility.

*Personal Note: I need hide this journal to a secret place. I now believe my work has been corrupted for purposes that directly contradict my goal of eliminating the undead threat. The Starstone research was never intended to neutralize undead—it was meant to control them as weapons or tools. Director Valentin's conversations with these new visitors revealed plans regarding Knight-Commander Iomedae that I find deeply disturbing. She's one of the few Vanguard leaders actively hunting down necromantic corruption wherever it's found. I heard fragments of their discussion about "intercepting" her when she returns for another inspection.*

*[The final sentences are written in haste and barely readable]*

*The instability of magical energies is escalating. I am trying to disperse it using divine essence but failing or perhaps the quantities were insufficient. More essence is needed, maybe a more refined extraction is can stabilize this situation before it spirals completely out of control. I've encrypted a message to Iomedae warning her about what I've discovered, though I fear it's too late. If anyone finds this journal, know that I joined this project to find a way to destroy the undead plague forever, not to perfect methods of controlling it. I believe Knight-Commander Iomedae shares this mission. I pray she receives my warning in time.*

*[The journal ends here. Several blank pages follow, suggesting the researcher intended to continue her documentation.]*
