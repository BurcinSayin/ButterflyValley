## Project Reflections - 17th of Progressflame, 3825
Our research here at Whisperhold has progressed far beyond my initial expectations. What began as simple experimentation with undead subjects has revealed profound implications about the nature of divine power itself. The Council was right all along—divine essence can be harnessed, redirected, even *transferred*. The implications are staggering.

Each successful binding of a divine spark to undead tissue proves the fundamental theory that has guided our organization's most ambitious work. The path we walk is longer than most realize, but these small successes confirm we move in the right direction.

I've always maintained that divine entities are humanity's greatest threat—not because they are inherently malevolent, but because they interfere in mortal affairs without accountability. These so-called "gods" play with human lives, demanding worship and obedience while offering little true protection. The Vanguard's vision of removing these troublesome divine powers from our world is not mere ambition—it is necessary for humanity's continued survival and independence.

At times I wonder if my brothers and sisters in the Eternal Rest Society would fully approve of our methods here. While we share a reverence for the undead form, my work here serves a greater purpose than simple preservation of flesh. The Great Goddess would understand, I believe—death itself is but another transformation, another tool to be wielded by those with the vision and will to do so.

## Project "Broken Sword" Status - 23th of Wealthgrow, 3827
With the Shining Crusade coming to its conclusion, Project "Broken Sword" represents our most ambitious undertaking yet. The specially infused Starstone fragments we've prepared over the past decades embody the ancient, secret knowledge of divine essence manipulation that few in the Vanguard are privileged to access. That I was personally selected to lead this aspect of the operation still fills me with pride.

The coordination required for this operation was extraordinary. Two fragments, each prepared with complementary properties, one from our main facility in Vanguard City focusing on binding techniques, and one from Kyonin engineered for essence disruption. Together, they would create the synchronistic resonance necessary to establish a foothold against Ragathiel, whose power has grown considerably during the Crusade.

Ragathiel represents a unique challenge given his extra-planar nature. Unlike Golarion-based divine entities, his power source exists beyond our world, making him particularly difficult to affect. Our theoretical models suggest the specialized binding techniques would establish a foothold when both fragments are deployed together, each representing one aspect of his dual nature as both vengeful judge and compassionate protector.

The Council's interest in neutralizing Ragathiel specifically stems from the alarming growth of his influence during the Crusade. His pattern of direct intervention in mortal affairs has become increasingly disruptive to the Vanguard's plans. If left unchecked, his cult will continue to spread beyond the battlefields.

The Great Goddess understands that true power comes from controlling the threshold between life and death. These fragments will allow us to do just that—to grasp a measure of control over a divine entity who has grown too powerful, too quickly. The hunger for immortality drives us all, does it not? But only through proper understanding and reverence for death's mysteries should such power be wielded.

## Operational Security Concerns - 19th of Triumphcrest, 3827
Knight-Commander Iomedae's unexpected interest in our facility is deeply troubling. Her questions during today's inspection reveal dangerous insight—how much does she truly know about our operations here? Her background with the Shining Crusade grants her unique perspective on divine matters, and her natural charisma and leadership have already gathered a concerning following among the crusaders.

This visit appears unrelated to the Starstone fragment shipments for Project "Broken Sword," but the timing is concerning nonetheless. Her growing reputation for sniffing out corruption could pose a threat to all our work, not just our operations against Ragathiel.

I've encoded my concerns in the latest communication to the Council, emphasizing the potential threat she poses. If she continues to investigate, more permanent measures are absolutely required. Key projects cannot be compromised at this stage.

In my prayers to the Great Goddess, I've asked for guidance. The path forward seems clear—Iomedae must be stopped before she disrupts our operations further. Her rising stature among the crusaders makes her particularly dangerous, as she has the influence to turn public opinion against us should she discover the true nature of our work.

## Concerns About Subject 7 - 3rd of Freedomrise, 3828
Subject 7's reference to "the woman in silver armor" troubles me greatly. The specimen has no possible way of knowing about Knight-Commander Iomedae's visit, yet spoke of her with unsettling familiarity. More concerning was the phrase "break the divine chains"—an uncomfortably accurate description of our control method for the undead.

Could our necromantic bindings be somehow affected by lingering divine influence? If so, the implications for our control methods are... concerning. I've not shared these observations with the research team. Some matters are meant only for those who understand the higher purposes of our work with the dead.

This incident is completely unrelated to our work on Project "Broken Sword" and Ragathiel, yet I can't help but wonder if there are connections we don't yet understand between our various efforts to counter divine entities. The Eternal Rest Society teaches that death creates connections that transcend mortal understanding—perhaps these undead subjects retain some sensitivity to the divine that we've failed to fully appreciate. This warrants further investigation, though discretely.

## Intercepted Shipment - 30th of Freedomrise, 3828
Disastrous news arrived today. Knight-Commander Iomedae has somehow intercepted the Starstone fragment shipment from Kyonin intended for Project "Broken Sword". This represents a critical security breach and a significant setback to our operation against Ragathiel. Without both fragments working in tandem, our efforts will be severely compromised.

Our own fragment which came from Vanguard City remains secure, but alone it lacks the necessary properties to fulfill the project's objectives. I've encoded an emergency communication to the Council, emphasizing the serious nature of this development. The greater question remains: how did Iomedae learn of this shipment, and what does she know of its purpose? She has no connection to Ragathiel or our operations against him.

I've requested immediate reinforcement of security protocols at all facilities involved in the secondary stages of Project "Broken Sword." The fragment in her possession represents not just decades of research, but a crucial component that can't be easily replaced.

The hunger of the Great Goddess will not be denied. If Iomedae interferes with our sacred work, she must be made to understand the true nature of death—not as an end, but as a transformation into something greater.

## Personal Reflection - 2nd of Dutyhold, 3828
Sometimes I question if we truly understand the forces we manipulate. The ancient texts speak of gods as limited beings, constrained by their portfolios and mortal belief. Yet each new discovery reveals greater complexity. The divine is not simply power to be harvested—it contains memory, will, perhaps even fragments of consciousness.

But doubt is a luxury we cannot afford. My own family was destroyed by divine conflict—my parents and sisters butchered when jealous Pharasma's servants attacked our village, targeting the few devoted to the Great Goddess. I've witnessed firsthand how these so-called "benevolent deities" view the followers of my Lady as abominations to be purged, never considering our right to pursue immortality through her blessed transformations.

The path was set long ago—the elimination of competing divine entities is necessary for the Great Goddess to flourish. Other deities restrain her power, limit her domain over death and undeath. History will remember us not as defilers, but as the architects of true freedom from mortality—a world where only the Great Goddess remains to guide humanity beyond the limitations of life and death.

The Vanguard's vision aligns perfectly with my worship of the Great Goddess. While they seek to eliminate all divine influence, I serve a greater purpose—ensuring that when their work is complete, only my Lady remains, hidden beneath their blind spots, ready to emerge as the sole divine power in a world cleansed of her rivals. My service to both the Vanguard and the Eternal Rest Society is not contradictory—both paths serve to elevate humanity beyond its current limitations, though through different methods.

## Iomedae's Return - 13th of Dutyhold, 3828
The High Command has informed me that Knight-Commander Iomedae is returning with a larger contingent for a more thorough investigation. All personnel except for a small security team are to be evacuated. I'm to ensure no evidence of the facility's activities remains accessible.

The implications are clear - they intend for neither Iomedae nor her contingent to leave Whisperhold. I find myself unexpectedly conflicted. While I understand the necessity, there is a certain... waste in this approach. A warrior of Iomedae's caliber would make an exceptional undead servant if properly preserved and controlled.

The Great Goddess teaches us that death is merely a transformation, not an end. Perhaps there might be an opportunity here to honor her teachings while still fulfilling my duties to the Vanguard. I shall consider this carefully in the coming days.

## Unexpected Visitation - 17th of Dutyhold, 3828
Today has been extraordinary beyond measure. Without any prior notification, the High Inquisitor himself materialized within our ritual chamber—appearing with an escort of elite guards right in the center of our most secure area during our evacuation preparations. The shock among the staff was palpable, but nothing compared to my own when he presented his credentials.

The insignia he bore was of the highest rank! I immediately knelt in deference—such an honor has never been recorded at a field installation of our level. That one of the Council's most enigmatic and powerful members would personally attend to our situation speaks volumes about the importance of our work here.

His knowledge of our operations was comprehensive to an unsettling degree, as if he had studied our research for years, though no reports have ever been sent directly to his office. More remarkable still was his awareness of my private theories—concepts I've never documented in official communications.

Why would one of such rank concern himself with our modest facility? His explanation was cryptic at best: "The convergence of paths necessitates direct intervention." He spoke of Knight-Commander Iomedae as if her investigation was anticipated long ago, referring to her not as a current threat but as a "historical inevitability."

I dare not speculate further, even in these private notes, but the implications of his presence here suggest connections to aspects of the Grand Design I had previously considered theoretical at best.

## Final Observations - 18th of Dutyhold, 3828
Strange phenomena have been occurring throughout the outpost since the High Inquisitor's arrival in the ritual chamber. The anomalies began there, intensely concentrated around the central altar, but have since spread throughout the facility. Objects move without being touched. Unnatural shadows dance across walls with no source. Reality itself seems to waver at the edges of my vision. 

The effect on our specimens has been even more dramatic, particularly Subjects 2, 3, 7, and 9, who now display abilities that defy our understanding of necromantic potential. Those closest to the ritual chamber were affected first and most severely, but the strange effects have now reached even the peripheral areas of our facility.

The High Inquisitor showed no surprise at these effects. When I expressed concern, he merely stated, "Such distortions are a necessary consequence of our methods." He then gathered our most critical research materials / resources and departed with his team toward the eastern clearing, mentioning an imminent confrontation with Knight-Commander Iomedae.

Before leaving, he placed his hand on my shoulder and spoke words that filled me with pride: "Your contributions to the Great Work will be remembered long after you're gone, Director. The Hourglass symbol of our order represents not just the passing of time, but the preservation of our achievements through the generations."

I believe this was his way of acknowledging my dedication to the Council's ultimate vision. Such recognition from one of his stature is unprecedented—if I survive the current crisis, my standing will surely be elevated.

The facility is now in chaos. Containment failures multiply faster than we can respond. I've ordered emergency sealing procedures, but it may be too late. If these notes are found, let them serve as testament to our unwavering commitment to humanity's liberation from divine chains. 

The Great Goddess will remember those who served her faithfully, even as mortal organizations crumble. Death comes for us all, but for the worthy, it is merely a beginning.
