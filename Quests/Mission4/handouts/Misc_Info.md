Vanguard Containment Team Leader Alexie Cavenur - 21 Freedomrise, 3876

Facility assessment complete after decades of quarantine. Previous containment teams were lost attempting to secure this site, necessitating the development of new protective measures before this successful operation could be mounted. Unexplained anomalies remain at dangerous levels nearly 50 years after the incident.

All access is forbidden

To the land of shadows will I fade.
Seek me not, observe the unfolding moments instead.

When the Vanguard's false dawn is swallowed by the true night, 
I will return for eyes that see past the hourglass
