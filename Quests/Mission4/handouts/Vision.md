# Vision at the Silent Glade

---

Knight-Commander Iomedae stands in this very clearing, her silver armor gleaming in the moonlight. The Vanguard insignia is emblazoned on her breastplate, meticulously polished despite the numerous small dents and scratches that mark a veteran of countless battles. She carries a matching shield, its surface showing the patina of heavy use yet maintained with soldier's precision; it has the "hourglass in a triangle" symbol on the right and a "sword and sun" symbol on the left. Her entire appearance speaks of disciplined functionality—nothing ornate or flashy, but clean and serviceable, reflecting a warrior who understands proper equipment maintenance as a matter of survival rather than appearance.

She is surrounded by seven knights, their armor similarly battle-worn but well-maintained. Each bears the marks of seasoned veterans—repaired straps, burnished patches where blades have struck, reinforced joints that have seen too many conflicts to count. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, they carry themselves with the quiet confidence of soldiers who have faced death many times and lived to stand ready once more. Their eyes hold the steady gaze of those who have seen too much yet remain unwavering in their purpose. The Vanguard insignias on their equipment have been retraced and maintained through years of service, some older versions visible beneath the current markings, a testament to their long tenure in the organization.

"They come," says one of the knights, a tall half-elven woman with a scar across her cheek. Though something in her ageless eyes suggests she has witnessed centuries pass, her face bears none of time's usual marks—as if the years had somehow flowed around rather than through her. A small emblem of a rose bud emerging from thorns adorns her collar, and there's a quiet rebellious strength to her stance, like one who has challenged authority countless times before.

Iomedae nods. "Remember your oaths. What we defend today is not just our lives, but the very light that guides us." As she speaks, she clutches a small lead-lined box at her side, the faint blue glow of its contents barely visible through the seams.

From the trees emerge seven figures in dark robes bearing the insignia of the Eternal Vanguard. Their exposed skin—faces, hands, and forearms—bears intricate tattoos of arcane symbols that seem to shift and flow like living things. The runes pulse with a cold blue light, crawling across their flesh in hypnotic patterns, forming and dissolving complex glyphs that seem to whisper forgotten secrets. At their center stands a regal figure whose face is nearly obscured by the density of these living marks, holding a staff topped with a small crystalline object that pulses in rhythm with the tattoos.

"Knight-Commander Iomedae," the leader says, voice smooth and reasonable. "You possess something that belongs to the Vanguard. Return the fragment you intercepted, and you may yet leave this place alive."

Iomedae's voice rings clear through the clearing. "What I carry is truth, High Inquisitor. This fragment proves the corruption in Vanguard, which was founded to protect humanity, not to harvest divine power for your own ends."

The High Inquisitor sighs. "Such limited vision from one with so much potential. We seek to free humanity from divine dependence, to place our destiny in our own hands. Surely that aligns with your desire for justice?"

"Justice," Iomedae replies, "is not achieved through theft and deception. You do not seek to free humanity—you seek to replace the gods with yourselves."

The half-elf woman steps forward, her scarred face hardening with resolve. "Freedom isn't something granted by those in power," she interjects, her voice resonant with quiet fury. "It's seized by those who refuse to be silenced. You claim to liberate humanity, but true liberation comes from the people themselves, from their own courage to resist and rise against those who would control them."

The High Inquisitor's face hardens, the runes on his skin accelerating their movement, coalescing around his eyes in patterns of ancient power. "Then you leave us no choice." He raises his staff, and the crystal at its tip flares blindingly bright.

The battle erupts with impossible speed. Iomedae and her knights fight with supernatural skill, their weapons trailing silver light as they cut through the Vanguard forces. But the High Inquisitor's team wields strange weapons that seem to distort the very fabric of reality around them. Where they strike, mysterious energies warp—wounds appear before blades connect, knights age decades in seconds. The tattoos on the Vanguard forces flare with each attack, forming protective sigils and offensive runes that leap from skin to weapon.

You watch as Iomedae's seven companions fall one by one, succumbing to the dark energies and temporal distortions. Some knights age centuries in moments before collapsing, others vanish into rifts in reality, their screams cut short, while the rest are struck down by the Vanguard agents' profane power, their bodies lifeless on the glade floor. Each knight falls defending their commander and their ideals to the very last.

Despite the overwhelming force against her, Iomedae fights on. Her sword blazes with silver fire as she cuts through the Vanguard's ranks, making her way toward the High Inquisitor himself.

"You cannot win, Iomedae," he calls to her. "Even now, you draw on the very power we have learned to harvest. The difference is that we control it, while you merely channel it."

"You're wrong," Iomedae replies, parrying a magical blast from his staff. "This power was never meant to be controlled. It is meant to be served."

As the battle reaches its climax, Iomedae stands alone against the High Inquisitor and his remaining forces. Her armor is battered, her face streaked with blood, but her eyes burn with unwavering determination.

The High Inquisitor raises his staff for a final attack, the tattoos across his body converging into a single, complex pattern that radiates malevolent power. "Your sacrifice will be remembered only as a failure," he says.

As the High Inquisitor unleashes his attack, Iomedae raises her sword to meet it shouting: "Truth that burns beneath oppression, Courage that stands when hope seems lost, Honor that cannot be chained, Vengeance that strikes against tyranny—bear witness to this moment!"

The two forces—his stolen divine essence and her freely-given divine connection—collide in a cataclysm of light and energy. The lead box erupts with brilliant light, the container shattering as divine energy pours forth. Iomedae collapses to the unforgiving ground, her once-gleaming panoply now a testament to the battle's fury, armor breached and warped by unnatural heat; her shield, its structure fractured by force and its surface grotesquely reshaped by intense heat while her faithful blade was reduced to mere shards. Her loyal knights lie dead around her, their sacrifice stark upon the earth.

The High Inquisitor and his seven dark-robed agents also lie dead, their forms twisted. The very earth beneath seven of these fallen Vanguard agents rebels against their corruption, burning and charring into seven distinct blackened patches, a grim monument to their villainy. The High Inquisitor's own remains seem to petrify and contort, forming a crude, stone-like altar in the midst of this desolation.

As life fades from Iomedae, a massive figure appears in the clearing—a winged being with armored skin and burning eyes, bearing a flaming sword. The figure kneels beside Iomedae's fallen form.

"Your stand has been witnessed, brave knight," his voice resonates not in the air but directly in your minds. "Your sacrifice will not be forgotten, though they may erase your name from history."

He reaches down and touches Iomedae's forehead. "In another time, another world, your path might have led to godhood. Here, I can only promise that your fight will continue through others who share your spirit."

The Vengeance-Bearer gathers the fragments of Iomedae's shattered sword, now seven pieces glimmering with mysterious light. He lifts six of them skyward, and they streak away like shooting stars in different directions—to distant lands where they might one day be found by those worthy. The seventh fragment—the one you now possess—he places upon the petrified remains of the High Inquisitor, which has formed into that stone formation resembling an altar.

"This shard shall remain upon these cursed remains, a testament to valor piercing the heart of villainy—a fitting punishment for the architect of this betrayal, and a constant mark of his transgressions. This blighted ground, too, shall bear witness to the corruption that fell here," he declares. "Let those with eyes to see find it when the time is right."

With a final look at the fallen knight, the winged figure dissolves into motes of silver light that scatter into the night sky. Something of his presence seems to linger in the shimmering fragment, though in what manner you cannot say.

As he vanishes, Iomedae's seven loyal knights bodies gently dissolve, and from that hallowed ground spring vibrant blooms of daisy-like flowers, their pure white petals radiating around a vivid crimson center – the 'knight's tears.' These flowers pulse with a soft, sorrowful light. The seven blackened patches where the Vanguard agents fell continue to smolder with a palpable aura of dread.
