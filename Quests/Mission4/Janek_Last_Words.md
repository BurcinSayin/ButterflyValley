**To Whoever Finds This Record,**

If these words are ever found, let them stand as my final testament. My name is Janek. I served the Vanguard, third-in-command under Captain Alexie and Leutenant Lorien. We were tasked with sealing a cursed lab deep within the Fangwood. A duty, I thought. Gods, how wrong I was.

First we found a clearing... unnatural. That altar, the feeling in the air, the flowers they called "knight's tears" blooming near scorched earth. We lost good soldiers there, fighting things that wore strange uniforms, twisted versions of ours. Young Elara... gone, just for scrap metal the brothers demanded. Was it worth it? No orders feelt right after that.

Then we found the lab below. It was a place of nightmares – bodies twisted, science gone mad. We followed orders, smashed what we could, burned records, threw the dead bodies into a pit like refuse. More died. For what? For "containment"?

The deepest cut wasn't from the dead. It was from the living. Alexie, Lorien – they sealed us in. The survivors. Trapped us in the vault with the things we gathered. "Final containment," they called it. Ten men walked away, leaving their comrades to die. Betrayed. Abandoned. May the Vanguard's honor choke them.

Hours turned into a nightmare. Maybe hours, maybe days. We battered the vault door, screamed until our throats were raw, clawed at the seams until our fingers bled. Nothing. Hope drained away like water through cracked earth. Just exhaustion and the stench of death remained. Then, when the last spark of defiance guttered out, he came. Not through the door we couldn't breach. Just... appeared amidst the despair. Clad in rags, clutching a strange dagger, he moved with an impossible, twitching grace for something so clearly dead. Madness flickered in his eyes, but there was a terrifying awareness too. He seemed to know our moves before we made them, anticipating every desperate lunge, every futile swing. All of us charged him, driven by rage or sheer terror. He cut us down like wheat, his movements erratic yet brutally precise.

I was the last one standing and he paused before me. A flicker of… recognition? Maybe, just calculation. Then, his voice, unnervingly calm amidst the madness in his eyes, echoed in the vault, "A final record, knight? An opportunity to leave your mark?". He gestured almost formally towards my writing tools and the half burned scraps of papers around, offering this strange courtesy before stepping back. A final insult, perhaps?

The banging starts again… inside my head now. The whispers. This place… the Vanguard’s secrets… they are poison. Whoever finds this, know the truth. Know what they sacrificed us for. Tell someone. Let our deaths mean *something*.

At least I die like a knight, fighting, not forgotten in the dark. Gods forgive... us all.
