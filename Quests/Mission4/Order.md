## WHISPERHOLD OUTPOST DIRECTIVE #127-B

**FROM:** High Commander Thaddeus Blackwood, Eternal Vanguard Northern Defense Division  
**TO:** Commander Alaric Thornheart, Fangwood Division  
**SUBJECT:** Whisperhold Outpost Security Protocols  
**DATE:** 15 Freedomrise, 3828

Commander Thornheart,

This communication serves to formalize your assignment to oversee security operations in the Northern Fangwood region, with particular emphasis on Whisperhold Outpost perimeter defense and ongoing research facility security.

### BACKGROUND

Whisperhold Outpost was established during the Shining Crusade as a forward operating base against undead incursions. It has maintained strategic importance in our northern defense network, with current operations focusing on critical research initiatives.

### CURRENT SITUATION

Intelligence reports indicate increased activity in the region that warrants heightened security measures. Of particular note, Knight-Commander Iomedae has been conducting independent patrols beyond her assigned sector. Her recent movements suggest an interest in our northern operations and the sensitive research conducted at the facility.

### DIRECTIVES

1. **Security Enhancement**
   - Increase patrol frequency around the outpost perimeter
   - Implement rotating recognition codes, changing every 48 hours
   - Maintain detailed records of all personnel entering and exiting the facility
   - Ensure continued discretion regarding ongoing research operations

2. **Restricted Zones**
   - The sealed underground facility remains strictly off-limits
   - Any attempts to access sealed areas must be reported immediately
   - Enforce "need-to-know" protocols regarding historical operations and current research

3. **Intelligence Gathering**
   - Monitor movement patterns of Knight-Commander Iomedae's unit
   - Report any unusual activity in the surrounding region
   - Maintain communication blackout regarding the outpost's precise operational status

### SPECIAL DIRECTIVE: IOMEDAE
Knight-Commander Iomedae has recently distinguished herself in the final campaigns of the Shining Crusade. Her exemplary leadership and uncanny ability to sense undead corruption have earned her significant latitude in conducting independent investigations. However, her growing interest in our northern operations, particularly her inquiries about unusual supply requisitions for the Whisperhold research facility, represents a potential security concern.

Should Knight-Commander Iomedae approach Whisperhold Outpost, you are authorized to deny her entry under protection ward protocol 17-A ("magical operations in progress"). Under no circumstances is she to be allowed access to the sealed underground facility or research scrolls.

If she persists or demonstrates unusual interest in the facility, you are to detain her and notify High Command immediately for further instructions.

### COMMAND STRUCTURE

While you maintain independent command of security operations, you will continue to provide operational reports to Director Alaric Valentin regarding facility security and research support.

### TIMELINE

- Security enhancements to be implemented effective immediately
- Weekly reports required, daily if Iomedae's unit approaches within 50 miles
- Rotation of your forces scheduled for 60 days from receipt of this directive

By order of the Eternal Vanguard, these directives supersede all previous commands.

For the preservation of order and prosperity,

*[Arcane Seal of Authentication]*

High Commander Thaddeus Blackwood  
Northern Defense Division  
Eternal Vanguard
