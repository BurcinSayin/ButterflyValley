# Commander Thornheart's Journal - Whisperhold Outpost

---

**3rd of Progressflame, 3825**  
Arrived at Whisperhold today. The outpost appears well-positioned to monitor undead activity in the region as publicly stated. My private orders, however, make it clear that I am to provide security for the research facility beneath without inquiring about its purpose. Director Alaric Valentin barely acknowledged my arrival, making it clear that my authority extends only to the surface operations and perimeter security.

---

**17th of Progressflame, 3825**  
Attempted my first inspection of the underground facility today but was denied access beyond the entry checkpoint. Director Valentin informed me that my security clearance only permits me to secure the perimeter and entrances. When I inquired about the nature of the research, I was sharply reminded that such matters are beyond my purview. Surface operations and maintaining our cover story – those are my only concerns.

---

**8th of Unityfall, 3825**  
Supply shipment arrived today. Noted unusual items in the manifest - specialized alchemical components I don't recognize, and several heavily secured containers marked only with the Vanguard's highest security classification. My responsibility ended once these were transferred to Director Valentin's research team. The courier made it clear: my duty is to log the delivery, not inquire about contents.

---

**21st of Wisdomshadow, 3825**  
Received a formal request from Director Valentin for additional security around the eastern perimeter of the compound. No explanation provided, of course. I've doubled the guard rotation as requested, selecting only the most discreet men. The researchers come and go at all hours, looking exhausted, but none speak to my soldiers.

**14th of Futureship, 3826**  
Director Valentin and his team seem pleased with their progress. The guards report hearing strange sounds from the underground facility - sounds like moaning or shuffling. When I inquired, I was told they were testing "enhanced biological defense mechanisms" - whatever that means. I've instructed my men to log all unusual occurrences but to keep their observations to themselves.

---

**2nd of Revisiondawn, 3826**  
More specialized equipment arrived today. Caught a glimpse of requisition forms mentioning something called "Project Eternal Hope" before they were quickly removed from my sight. My legitimate concerns about securing a facility whose purpose I don't understand continue to be dismissed. The researchers avoid all contact with my men.

---

**19th of Triumphcrest, 3827**  
The Shining Crusade is officially ending. There's talk of reassignment for many of the outposts, but Director Valentin has made it clear that our facility will continue operations. If anything, the researchers seem to be working with increased urgency. Supply deliveries have nearly doubled in frequency.

---

**19th of Triumphcrest, 3828**  
Knight-Commander Iomedae arrived today, asking pointed questions about our operations. I've heard much about her honorable reputation and impeccable service record during the Crusade. She presented proper authorization for a routine inspection, but Director Valentin appeared unusually concerned by her presence. She's investigating unusual undead activity in the region. Her thorough questioning of my surface personnel has been relentless but fair. I've been instructed to cooperate fully while ensuring she remains restricted to the surface levels, which sits poorly with me given her distinguished standing in the Vanguard.

---

**10th of Progressflame, 3828**  
Incident at the eastern clearing today. Director Valentin has refused to explain what happened, but three researchers are dead and I've been ordered to increase security around the entire perimeter. My men report hearing inhuman screams before the research team's security detail locked down the area. We were explicitly forbidden from investigating. I'm growing increasingly uncomfortable with my role here.

---

**30th of Freedomrise, 3828**  
Received troubling reports that Knight-Commander Iomedae is returning with a larger contingent for a more thorough investigation. Unusual activity in the research facility – personnel moving equipment, burning documents. I've received sealed orders from Vanguard City regarding how to handle her arrival. After reading them, I find myself questioning everything about our mission here. The directives concerning the Knight-Commander are... unconscionable. To act against someone of her caliber and honor would be a betrayal of everything the Vanguard once stood for.

---

**2nd of Dutyhold, 3828**  
I must document this somewhere, though I risk everything by writing it down. I still don't know what exactly happens in that facility, but the orders regarding Knight-Commander Iomedae can only mean one thing: whatever they're doing down there is something she would find objectionable enough to report. And my orders are to ensure she never gets that chance. For the first time in my career, I'm considering disobeying direct orders.

---

**13th of Dutyhold, 3828**  
The High Command has ordered the facility to be sealed following Iomedae's next visit. All personnel except for a small security team are to be evacuated. I'm to ensure no evidence of the facility's activities remains accessible. The implications are clear - they intend for neither Iomedae nor her contingent to leave Whisperhold. I cannot be complicit in this. Whatever they're hiding, it isn't worth the life of Knight-Commander Iomedae, whose dedication to our people I've admired throughout my career. May the gods forgive what I'm about to do.

---

**17th of Dutyhold, 3828**  
Something impossible happened today. A team arrived from Vanguard City by means I cannot explain - they simply appeared within our secured perimeter, bypassing all defenses. They wore Vanguard insignia but of a design I've never seen. Their leader, who identified himself as "High Inquisitor," immediately took command of the facility, superseding both myself and Director Valentin. Since their arrival, strange phenomena have been occurring throughout the outpost. My men report disorientation, seeing objects move before they're touched, and experiencing moments where time seems to flow backward. These bizarre effects began immediately after the High Inquisitor's arrival. I've never witnessed anything like this - it's as if reality itself is becoming unstable. The High Inquisitor and his team spent several hours gathering research materials and resting before departing southeast, presumably to intercept Knight-Commander Iomedae. They seemed unusually confident about knowing her exact location.

---

**18th of Dutyhold, 3828**  
This will likely be my final entry. The facility is overrun. After the High Inquisitor's team departed, we received reports of a massive magical confrontation at the eastern clearing. There was a blinding flash of silver light, and then... nothing. Meanwhile, the strange phenomena that began with the High Inquisitor's arrival are worsening. Men are aging decades in seconds or becoming frozen in time. The creatures from below have broken through to the surface levels despite our desperate attempts to seal the underground facility. Worse still, they've discovered a secret passage to the northwest and are attacking from outside as well. I'm leading the remaining guards in a last stand at the barracks. If anyone finds this journal, know that Knight-Commander Iomedae was right to investigate this place. Something terrible was happening here, something that violated the very principles the Vanguard was founded to uphold. And now we pay the price for our complicity.
