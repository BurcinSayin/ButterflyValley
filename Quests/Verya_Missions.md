### Bastion Mission Briefs

**Mission 1**
* **Region:** Cheliax (Egorian)
* **Regional Info:** Cheliax is a nation known for its strict adherence to law and order. Its state religion is the Eternal Vanguard, and its infamous "Vanguard Knights" know for their swift and brutal *solutions*. The Vanguard maintains a millenia long alliance with the nation which is ruled by powerfull noble houses.
* **Current State:** The nation is a cornerstone of Vanguard power, but not without internal dissent. A Liberators' Dawn cell operates out of the city of Westcrown, working to undermine Vanguard-aligned nobles and aid escaped slaves. The Vanguard oversees state facilities like the Citadel Rivas Prison, which uses a mix of common criminals and legal slaves for industrial production.
* **Objective:** Plant fabricated evidence on a high-ranking Justiciar within the "Order of the Scourge." The target is known to frequent exclusive high-society galas in Egorian, presenting a potential infiltration opportunity that will require considerable social maneuvering.

**Mission 4**
* **Region:** Varisia (Ravenhold)
* **Regional Info:** Varisia, with its rich Thassilonian legacy, is a region of critical strategic importance to the Vanguard, who view it as a treasure trove for their arcane and temporal research. They have systematically suppressed local cultures, particularly Varisian divination and the Shoanti warrior traditions, while publicly framing their rule as a period of integration and preservation.
* **Current State:** The city of Ravenhold, once a concentration camp for Shoanti tribes, is now a key administrative and educational hub for the Vanguard in the region. A Liberators' Dawn cell known as "The Sihedron Circle" operates here, focusing on liberating oppressed minorities and preserving ancient knowledge.
* **Objective:** Locate and neutralize a Vanguard cell in Ravenhold that is attempting to reactivate a Thassilonian artifact designed to detect Deja Vu individuals. An agent with experience in urban environments may be able to locate the cell, which is operating covertly within the city.

**Mission 7**
* **Region:** Andoran (Almas)
* **Regional Info:** Andoran's capital, Almas, is presented as a shining beacon of Vanguard ideals, founded after a "People's Revolt" supported by the Vanguard overthrew the old monarchy.
* **Current State:** The city is a major port and a hub of Vanguard power, governed by a Supreme Elect chosen through a process overseen by the Vanguard. A Liberators' Dawn cell, "Freedom's Flame," operates in the city, working to support underground pro-democracy movements.
* **Objective:** Uncover and expose a Vanguard scheme in Almas that uses fraudulent economic practices to eliminate merchants suspected of sympathizing with the Liberators' Dawn. Posing as a targeted merchant could provide the necessary cover to gather evidence from the inside.
