### Bastion Mission Briefs

**Mission 1**
* **Region:** Cheliax (Egorian)
* **Regional Info:** Cheliax is a nation known for its strict adherence to law and order. Its state religion is the Eternal Vanguard, and its infamous "Vanguard Knights" know for their swift and brutal *solutions*. The Vanguard maintains a millenia long alliance with the nation which is ruled by powerfull noble houses.
* **Current State:** The nation is a cornerstone of Vanguard power, but not without internal dissent. A Liberators' Dawn cell operates out of the city of Westcrown, working to undermine Vanguard-aligned nobles and aid escaped slaves. The Vanguard oversees state facilities like the Citadel Rivas Prison, which uses a mix of common criminals and legal slaves for industrial production.
* **Objective:** Plant fabricated evidence on a high-ranking Justiciar within the "Order of the Scourge." The target is known to frequent exclusive high-society galas in Egorian, presenting a potential infiltration opportunity that will require considerable social maneuvering.

**Mission 2**
* **Region:** Numeria
* **Regional Info:** This land of strange technology and barbarian tribes was swiftly brought under Vanguard influence after the "Rain of Stars". The Vanguard established multiple "Eternal Explorer" outposts, looted most of the advanced technology.
* **Current State:** Numeria is governed by a council of local tribe, city, and organization leaders, all of whom are overseen by the Eternal Vanguard. The Vanguard's primary interest is containing and studying the alien technology that litters the landscape, making the region a hotbed for their secret research projects.
* **Objective:** Sabotage a newly unearthed piece of alien technology that is causing temporal instability before Vanguard authorities can weaponize it.

**Mission 3**
* **Region:** Osirion
* **Regional Info:** This ancient nation has been under the thumb of the Eternal Vanguard for millennia. The Vanguard directly assisted in the nation's founding and fully assimilated it into their empire near the end of the "Golden Age".
* **Current State:** Osirion is under the complete control of the Eternal Vanguard. All its Pharaohs are puppets who undergo strict Vanguard indoctrination and education from a young age. The Vanguard's control is absolute, making any overt resistance nearly impossible.
* **Objective:** Publicly discredit a Vanguard-backed puppet Pharaoh by exposing the "ancient tomb" that legitimizes his rule as a forgery. The grand unveiling of the tomb presents an opportunity for an agent posing as a historical expert to identify the anachronisms.

**Mission 4**
* **Region:** Varisia (Ravenhold)
* **Regional Info:** Varisia, with its rich Thassilonian legacy, is a region of critical strategic importance to the Vanguard, who view it as a treasure trove for their arcane and temporal research. They have systematically suppressed local cultures, particularly Varisian divination and the Shoanti warrior traditions, while publicly framing their rule as a period of integration and preservation.
* **Current State:** The city of Ravenhold, once a concentration camp for Shoanti tribes, is now a key administrative and educational hub for the Vanguard in the region. A Liberators' Dawn cell known as "The Sihedron Circle" operates here, focusing on liberating oppressed minorities and preserving ancient knowledge.
* **Objective:** Locate and neutralize a Vanguard cell in Ravenhold that is attempting to reactivate a Thassilonian artifact designed to detect Deja Vu individuals. An agent with experience in urban environments may be able to locate the cell, which is operating covertly within the city.

**Mission 5**
* **Region:** Irrisen
* **Regional Info:** After Baba Yaga's invasion in 3313 AV, the Vanguard ( unable to win a decisive military victory ) signed the Treaty of Eternal Winter. This treaty grants Irrisen semi-autonomous status under the rule of queens who change every 100 years.
* **Current State:** A tense but stable balance of power exists. Irrisen pays regular tribute, and the Vanguard maintains designated research zones to study the region's unique magic. The Vanguard's primary interest here is acquiring otherworldly occult knowledge from Irrisen's powerful magic-users.
* **Objective:** Determine the status of a compromised Butterfly Valley asset embedded in the court of Irrisen's Winter Queen. The political landscape is treacherous, balanced between the ruling witches and Vanguard observers.

**Mission 6**
* **Region:** The Gravelands (Ustalav border)
* **Regional Info:** Ustalav was saved from the Whispering Tyrant by a Vanguard-organized Shining Crusade. However, due to player actions during the altered "Tyrant's Grasp" events, a handful of knights survived the fall of the Ustalavic Administrative Zone.
* **Current State:** The surviving knights have declared independence from the Vanguard, re-establishing the "Knights of Lastwall" as an active military order. They are now a valuable ally of the Liberators' Dawn and actively fight Vanguard forces in the Gravelands region.
* **Objective:** Correct a critical flaw in an ambush planned by the Knights of Lastwall against a Vanguard supply convoy to ensure its success. The primary challenge will be earning the Knights' trust to alter their plan without revealing the temporal nature of the intelligence and or existance of Butterfly Valley.

**Mission 7**
* **Region:** Andoran (Almas)
* **Regional Info:** Andoran's capital, Almas, is presented as a shining beacon of Vanguard ideals, founded after a "People's Revolt" supported by the Vanguard overthrew the old monarchy.
* **Current State:** The city is a major port and a hub of Vanguard power, governed by a Supreme Elect chosen through a process overseen by the Vanguard. A Liberators' Dawn cell, "Freedom's Flame," operates in the city, working to support underground pro-democracy movements.
* **Objective:** Uncover and expose a Vanguard scheme in Almas that uses fraudulent economic practices to eliminate merchants suspected of sympathizing with the Liberators' Dawn. Posing as a targeted merchant could provide the necessary cover to gather evidence from the inside.

**Mission 8**
* **Region:** The Mwangi Expanse
* **Regional Info:** The Ekujae elves of the Mwangi Jungle have preserved their history since before Earthfall in unique "living archives" of specially cultivated trees, making them a prime target for the history-altering Vanguard. They also possess ancient "god-killing" magic, "Anima Invocation," which the Vanguard covets.
* **Current State:** Following events that saw the Vanguard seize the city of Promise, the Ekujae elves have begun to openly oppose the Vanguard's presence in the jungle.
* **Objective:** Prevent a Vanguard-instigated war between a local Mwangi tribe and the Ekujae elves. The Vanguard is using fraudulent sacred omens to manipulate the tribe; an agent with skills in subterfuge and cultural analysis could expose the deception to the tribe's leadership.
