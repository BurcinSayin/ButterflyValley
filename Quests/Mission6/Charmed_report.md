## report from a charmed clerk from Records Hall

To: My Lady
From: K.

I am writing this with a shaking hand, but your presence has given me a strange sort of courage. You asked about the Records Hall, and while I am but a humble clerk of the Order of the Scourge, I see much from my station among the ledgers. Though we wear the sign of the Scourge, we all know that our ultimate service now lies with the Eternal Vanguard, a truth we serve even here in the heart of The Greens.

The building itself is a windowless, squat structure, now reinforced with lead-lined wards to prevent any prying eyes from seeing the work we do within. Inside, it never gets quiet. There are no magical presses to do the work for us; instead, the halls are filled with the scratching of pens as my fellow clerks and I work in shifts, twenty-four hours a day. It is an exhausting, never-ending task to keep up with the demands of the High Auditors.

My daily task is part of "Operation Clean Slate". This operation is under the direct command of Lord Barzillai Thrune, though it is fully supported and empowered by the Vanguard's influence. We are not merely filing history; we are actively manufacturing a new reality. We craft narratives where the Silver Ravens were never heroes, but rather unstable anarchists whose own paranoia drove them to murder one another.

We also serve as the processing center for everything seized under Proclamation the Tenth. The Dottari bring us crates of forbidden poetry and ancient histories, and our job is to classify every single page. We must determine if the writing poses a potential threat level against the stability of Cheliax. If a text is deemed a "threat," it is kept in the archives as evidence against the writer; if it is judged to pose no threat, the order is to destroy it immediately

Lately, the High Auditors have also tasked us with a new focus: we are to gather any and all data regarding the city's potential value as a testing ground to counter a group called the "Glorious Reclamation." From what I have gathered, they are a massive uprising of fanatical loyalists fighting a bloody stalemate in the south, rumors say they follow long lost ideals of the Shining Crusade. The Auditor is not here to stop Lord Thrune; they are evaluating if his experimental methods here could be used as an ultimate weapon against the rebels.

The woman who oversees the deeper works here is Mistress Tiarise Izoni. She is rarely seen by us, but she spends her time with dusty, ancient maps and reports concerning Kintargo's geographical layout and "Social Harmony." I heard she is mapping the city's "Reality Anchors." I don't know the true purpose of her work, but she seems to be building a ritualistic framework to anchor something to the city itself or a larger area.

Please, keep this safe. There are rumors among the desks of a "Control Archive" hidden somewhere in this very building—a place where the original, unredacted scrolls of the Silver Ravens are kept. I have never seen it myself, but if the original history still exists there, it would be a dangerous truth indeed. If my superiors knew I had spoken of this, I would not be writing to you again.

Yours,

K.
