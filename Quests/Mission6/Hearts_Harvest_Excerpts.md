# Excerpts from Heart’s Harvest, Volume X

*The following sections are fragments of the text that have been translated or deciphered from Tiarise Izoni's complex, annotated volume. Much of the book remains a dense thicket of arcane calculus and planar theory, but these passages stand out as somewhat legible.*

### On the Nature of the Anchor
"...the soul is a river, yet even the swiftest current can be stayed by the proper stone. To achieve the Harvest, one must first identify the Anchor. It is not enough to simply exist; one must be *fastened* to the very foundation of the realm. A vessel made of flesh is a poor mooring—it rots, it fades, it is subject to the whims of the tides. The true Anchor must be unyielding, immutable, and ancient. It must be a weight that remains even when the vital breath has departed and the clay has grown cold..."

### The Vessel of Resonances
"...sensory deprivation is the crucible. By silencing the cacophony of the pulse—the scent of the leaf, the taste of the brew—one allows the psychic field to become exceptionally receptive. This is the 'Quiet State,' a state of mimicked expiration where the boundaries between life and the beyond thrum at a negative-attuned frequency. In this silence, the consciousness may be stretched, thinned like gold leaf, until it can be draped over the Anchor. Note: the removal of the Night Tea and the Scent of Mint are surgical requirements to lower the city's collective resistance to the spectral reach..."

### The Boundless Anchor
"...a singular consciousness anchored to the bedrock becomes a fixed point. Should the current of existence branch or bend, the Anchor remains. To the one who is Harvested, 'then' and 'now' are merely different chambers of the same house, joined by a sepulchral stillness. The risk of fragmentation is high; without Volume II, the method of maintaining structural integrity during the severing of the silver cord remains... [the text here dissolves into recursive equations] ..."

### The Convergence of Veins
"...the Anchor alone is but a static weight; to pulse, it requires the lifeblood of the world. It is a fundamental law that the Anchor must be situated at a primary Ley Line intersection. This connection is governed by strict conditions: the 'vein' must be pierced at its highest local pressure, and the Anchor's resonance must be exactly tuned to the Ley Line's harmonic frequency. Failure to maintain this precise alignment results in a 'static bleed,' where the power of the land unravels the consciousness of the one it was meant to sustain. Only through this violent threading can the soul-current be harnessed and redirected for the Great Gathering..."

### The Price of the Harvest
"...to bind a spirit to the stone is to ask the stone to breathe. There is a hunger in the bedrock that must be satiated. The Harvest requires a harvest. For one to become the Pillar, others must become the dust. The energy for the final resonance cannot be generated; it must be *collected* from the thrumming life-force of a gathered multitude—a mass soul-binding of unparalleled scale. The Great Gathering provides the perfect alignment of expectation and excitement—the most potent fuel for the necromantic ignition..."
