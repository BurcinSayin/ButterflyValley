Okay, I can help you create a mission briefing for your players. Based on the information you've provided, here's a draft:

## Mission Briefing: The Kyonin Enigma

**Source:** Temporal Resistance Command // Eyes-Only for Field Operatives

**Date:** [Insert Current In-Game Date]

**Mission Code:** Nightingale's Thorn

**Subject:** Investigate Suspected Clandestine Eternal Vanguard Research Facility in Kyonin

**1. Overview:**
Intelligence gathered from our contacts within the Liberators' Dawn network indicates irregularities and supply chain discrepancies associated with the Eternal Vanguard's Tanglebriar defense line in Kyonin. While Liberators' Dawn lacks precise details, their analysts suspect these inconsistencies point towards an undeclared Vanguard operation in the region.

Further analysis by our own temporal researchers, cross-referencing Vanguard activity patterns and known predilections for repurposing sites of power, suggests the strong possibility of a secret research facility operating under deep cover. The most probable location for such a facility is within the treacherous Tanglebriar region, potentially at or near the old Thorn's End Fortress.

**2. Mission Objectives:**

* **Primary:**
    * Infiltrate the Veridian Watch settlement to gather initial intelligence on supply movements and personnel connected to the Tanglebriar defense line.
    * Identify the nature and precise location of the suspected secret Vanguard research facility (Codename: "Nightingale's Thorn," presumed to be at or near Thorn's End Fortress).
    * Ascertain the purpose of this covert facility and the nature of any research being conducted, with a particular focus on temporal, arcane, or bio-magical experimentation.
* **Secondary:**
    * Identify any key Vanguard personnel involved in the covert operation.
    * Assess the level of threat posed by the facility to local populations, elven sovereignty, and/or timeline integrity.
    * If possible and safe, secure any evidence of illicit or dangerous Vanguard activities.
    * Identify any individuals (Vanguard or local) who may possess Deja Vu abilities or are being experimented upon.

**3. Known Intelligence:**

* **Veridian Watch:** This settlement was established by the Eternal Vanguard around the ancient elven shrine of Imvrildara, now repurposed, and incorporates Fort Vigilance. Its official purpose is to act as a bulwark against the Tanglebriar and study the Imvrildara Center. It is the most logical starting point for investigating supply lines into the Tanglebriar.
* **Liberators' Dawn Intel:** Reports from Liberators' Dawn contacts highlight unusual types and quantities of supplies being routed towards the Tanglebriar defense line, inconsistent with standard garrison needs. They lack the resources and access to investigate further.
* **Vanguard Modus Operandi:** The Vanguard has a documented history of establishing secret facilities in remote, hazardous locations or repurposing ancient sites for their research, particularly concerning temporal mechanics, arcane power sources, and the study/exploitation of unique magical phenomena or individuals.

**4. Operational Parameters:**

* **Insertion Point:** Discretionary, but approach Veridian Watch with caution.
* **Cover:** Operatives should establish a plausible cover story (e.g., independent researchers, traders with specialized goods for Tanglebriar expeditions, or even disaffected Vanguard personnel seeking reassignment).
* **Engagement Protocol:** Prioritize stealth and intelligence gathering. Avoid direct confrontation with Vanguard forces unless absolutely necessary for mission success or survival. This is an intelligence-gathering operation, not an assault.
* **Timeline:** This mission is time-sensitive due to the ongoing accelerated Temporal Crisis.

**5. Potential Risks & Challenges:**

* **Vanguard Security:** Veridian Watch is a Vanguard military garrison, and any facility within the Tanglebriar will be heavily guarded.
* **Tanglebriar Hazards:** The Tanglebriar itself is a corrupted and exceedingly dangerous region. Expect environmental threats, corrupted flora and fauna, and potentially disorienting magical effects.
* **Elven Populace:** Kyonin elves, while some cooperate with the Vanguard at Veridian Watch, are generally wary of outsiders and fiercely protective of their lands. Their reaction to your presence is unpredictable.
* **Information Control:** The Vanguard excels at information suppression. Expect local knowledge to be limited or heavily curated.

**6. Extraction:**
Standard temporal marker protocols apply. Emergency extraction beacons are to be used only in dire circumstances.

**Final Directive:** The nature of Vanguard's interest in such a dangerous and remote Kyonin location warrants thorough investigation. Determine the truth behind these supply inconsistencies and uncover the secrets of "Nightingale's Thorn." The integrity of the timeline may depend on it.
