To my successor, to the future scions of the Vanguard,

If you are reading this, then our Grand Design continues, and you have proven worthy of entering this hallowed place. Welcome. You do not stand in a dusty laboratory, but in a monument to a pivotal moment in history—the dawn of true mortal freedom.

Look around you. This facility is not abandoned; it is preserved in perfect, timeless state. The guardians who patrol these halls and the silent Archivist who maintains its every surface are not jailers; they are the honor guard for our greatest achievement.

Within these walls, we harnessed the very firmament. We commanded the Elemental Forge, drawing upon the raw might of the planes to fuel our Great Work. It was here that we perfected the ***Essence Transference*** ritual, the delicate and monumental process of weaving pure cosmic and elemental power into a stable, singular form. Through this, we brought forth our triumph: the **Celestial Seed**.

Do not mistake its purpose. It is not a crude weapon. It is a key—a masterwork of arcane philosophy designed to sever the chains of divine tyranny at their source. The so-called gods are nothing more than celestial parasites, feeding on the worship of mortals. The Seed, when properly attuned, breaks their connection to that power, rendering them hollow and vulnerable to the glory of our ***Divine Power Siphon***. We have created the means to finally and irrevocably end their interference.

Of course, such groundbreaking work is not without its… complications. We must acknowledge the facility’s single regrettable failure: a half elven test subject. An early, flawed attempt at ***Essence Transference*** had the unintended side effect of severing her connection to the natural flow of time, rendering her ageless. While she proved a valuable subject for further study, this unnatural state eventually allowed her to develop abilities beyond our predictions. In time, she managed to exploit a flaw in our containment protocols and escaped into the forests of Kyonin. She is a loose thread, but an insignificant one in the grand tapestry of our success. Do not let this minor anomaly distract you from the prize.

Our true work here is done. This facility will stand as a testament, a silent library of the knowledge that will reshape our reality. The Celestial Seed, our perfect creation, has been sent onward to the fortress of **Aethel's Vigil**, where it awaits the great celestial alignment for the final harvest.

That task now falls to you and the generations that follow. You inherit the key to a new epoch. Wield it with the conviction and vision that only the Vanguard possesses. Go forth and usher in the dawn of our own making, a world free from the shadow of capricious gods.

Let the coming silence in the heavens be the anthem of our final victory.

**Warden Lyrion**
