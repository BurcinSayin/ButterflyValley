Okay, GM Helper, incorporating those specific details about the alters' awareness yields this final version of the report:

## **TEMPORAL RESISTANCE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT & CONTACT REPORT (Final Revision)**

**CLASSIFICATION:** Temporal Resistance Council EYES ONLY
**SUBJECT:** Kaelen Aetherion (Asset Designation: "Fractured Conduit")
**DATE:** Current Cycle, Post-Assessment Interval
**COMPILED BY:** Dr. Harmony Vale, Chief Medical Officer (Temporal Specialization), with input from Field Observation Team Delta & Mental Assessment Unit Gamma
**CROSS-REFERENCED SOURCES:** Initial Asset Intake Records, Field Observation Logs, Post-Extraction Psychiatric Evaluation Series, Mental Assessment Unit Incident Report.

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**
Psychological assessment and prolonged observation of Kaelen Aetherion ("Fractured Conduit") confirm a severe case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The root cause is self-inflicted psychic trauma from ritualistic attempts to contact Outer God entities, following the confirmed Eternal Vanguard purge of his family line. Five distinct personalities ("alters") have been documented. Crucially, the oracular alter known as "The Speaker" appears entirely dissociated from the others, possessing no shared consciousness or memory transfer. The remaining alters exhibit co-consciousness and shared memory amongst themselves but remain inaccessible regarding "The Speaker's" experiences. Direct communication attempts have failed due to the host's paranoia, and mental probing proved hazardous. After two years, no viable method for accessing Aetherion's potentially critical knowledge has been found, rendering the asset unusable.

**2. DIAGNOSIS & ETIOLOGY:**

* **Condition:** Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Psyche fragmented into distinct personality states.
* **Primary Cause:** Foundational trauma from the Vanguard purge of his family. Dissociative fracturing resulted directly from subsequent dangerous occult rituals performed by Aetherion to commune with Outer Gods.

---

**3. IDENTIFIED PERSONALITY STATES & INTERNAL AWARENESS:**
Field observation and direct assessment have identified the following alters:

* **"Kaelen" (Host):** Anxious, paranoid scholar personality, closest to the original. Emerges during relative calm or research focus. Holds core knowledge/trauma; emotionally fragile. *Shares memory/awareness with Warden, Aether, and Broker.*
* **"The Warden" (Protector):** Cold, ruthless, tactical survivalist. Emerges in response to immediate physical threats or pain. Handles combat/survival; highly suspicious. *Shares memory/awareness with Kaelen, Aether, and Broker.*
* **"Aether" (Trauma Holder):** Terrified child personality, embodies the horror of the family's destruction. Surfaces during extreme pain or via specific sensory triggers linked to the trauma. Communicates non-verbally or through fragmented whispers/drawings. *Shares memory/awareness with Kaelen, Warden, and Broker.*
* **"The Speaker" (Isolated Oracle Conduit):** Inhuman, detached state; direct conduit for Outer God communications. Speaks in cryptic, multi-layered prophecies. Triggered by divination rituals, meditation, temporal/planar instability, or direct mental intrusion. Possesses profound, dangerous knowledge; disconnected from reality. Crucially, this alter appears completely isolated. No other alter retains memories, thoughts, feelings, or knowledge from periods when "The Speaker" is manifest.
* **"The Broker" (Manipulator):** Charming, eloquent, apparently rational personality. Manifests Aetherion family guile. Emerges in complex social situations, negotiations, or when subtlety is required. Pragmatic and manipulative. *Shares memory/awareness with Kaelen, Warden, and Aether.*

The co-consciousness between Kaelen, Warden, Aether, and Broker means they generally recall events and actions that occurred while one of the others was dominant. However, the period during which "The Speaker" manifests is a complete amnestic gap for all other alters.

**4. COMMUNICATION & PROBING ATTEMPTS:**
Accessing the potentially critical prophetic knowledge held by "The Speaker" alter remains effectively impossible and hazardous, compounded by its isolation within Aetherion's psyche.

* **Host Resistance:** The primary "Kaelen" personality exhibits extreme, pervasive paranoia and distrust towards all observed individuals, preventing rapport necessary for controlled interaction.
* **Failed Probing Attempts:** Multiple attempts via charm and mind-reading magic have failed due to Host resistance or triggering of defensive alters.
* **Mind Reading Incident (Mental Assessment Unit):** One attempt involving mental probing  registered as a partial success, briefly connecting during a "Speaker" manifestation. The operative involved suffered catastrophic, targeted memory loss immediately afterward, retaining no information. This indicates an extreme psychic defense mechanism.
* **Internal Dissociation Barrier:** Even if contact with "The Speaker" were established, the complete lack of memory transfer to other alters means the information cannot be accessed through them later. The Host ("Kaelen") and other accessible alters have no recollection or understanding of what occurs during "Speaker" manifestations.
* **Cessation of Probing:** Following Incident and the confirmation of "The Speaker's" isolation, all direct probing attempts have been suspended indefinitely due to the high risk to operatives and the low probability of retrieving usable intelligence via other alters.

---

**5. ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* Kaelen Aetherion possesses potentially critical intelligence sourced from Outer God entities, but it is locked within the isolated "Speaker" alter.
* **Asset Status: Unusable & High Risk.** Aetherion's severe DID, profound paranoia, lack of trust, the hazardous psychic defenses encountered, and the complete isolation of the "Speaker" alter render him currently unusable as an intelligence asset. Two years of observation have failed to identify any method for safe or reliable access to the desired information.
* **Recommendation:** Maintain indefinite suspension of all direct contact and probing attempts. Downgrade Aetherion's status to "Subject - Observation Only." Maintain minimal, remote observation protocols for security purposes (potential risk due to Outer God connection). Re-evaluate status only if a significant, verifiable, and *spontaneous* change in his psychological state occurs *or* if a method to bypass both his paranoia and the internal dissociation barrier is unexpectedly discovered. Kaelen Aetherion should be considered a non-viable intelligence source and a potential psychic hazard.
