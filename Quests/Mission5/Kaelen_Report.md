**CLASSIFICATION:** Temporal Resistance EYES ONLY\
**SUBJECT:** Kaelen Aetherion (Asset Designation: "Fractured Conduit")\
**DATE:** Current Cycle, Post-Assessment Interval\
**COMPILED BY:** Harmony Vale, Chief Medical Officer, with input from Bastion Observation Team 1 & Mental Assessment Unit 2
**CROSS-REFERENCED SOURCES:** Initial Asset Intake Records, Bastion City Observation Logs, Post-Extraction Psychiatric Evaluation Reports, Mental Assessment Unit Incident Report.

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**

Psychological assessment and prolonged observation of Kaelen Aetherion ("Fractured Conduit") confirm a severe case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).
The root cause is hypothesized to be self-inflicted psychic trauma from ritualistic practices, following the confirmed Eternal Vanguard purge of his family line.
Five distinct personality states ("alters") have been documented. One state, designated "The Speaker," exhibits anomalous, incoherent pronouncements of unclear origin and appears entirely dissociated from the others, possessing no shared consciousness or memory transfer.
The remaining alters exhibit co-consciousness and shared memory amongst themselves but remain amnestic regarding periods when "The Speaker" state is manifest.
Direct communication attempts have been hampered by the host's pervasive paranoia, and mental probing proved hazardous. After two years, no viable method for safely accessing or even verifying any *useful* knowledge from "The Speaker" state has been found.
The asset's pronouncements are as likely to be mad ramblings as they are to be genuine intelligence, rendering him unusable for reliable analysis at this time.

**2. DIAGNOSIS & ETIOLOGY:**

* **Condition:** Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Psyche fragmented into distinct personality states.
* **Hypothesized Primary Cause:** Foundational trauma from the Vanguard purge of his family.
Dissociative fracturing is believed to have resulted directly from subsequent dangerous occult rituals performed by Aetherion.

**3. IDENTIFIED PERSONALITY STATES & INTERNAL AWARENESS:**
Field observation and direct assessment have identified the following states:

* **"Kaelen" (Host):** Anxious, paranoid scholar personality, closest to the original. Emerges during relative calm or research focus. Holds core knowledge/trauma; emotionally fragile. *Shares memory/awareness with Warden, Aether, and Broker*.
* **"The Warden" (Protector):** Cold, ruthless, tactical survivalist. Emerges in response to immediate physical threats or pain. Handles combat/survival; highly suspicious. *Shares memory/awareness with Kaelen, Aether, and Broker*.
* **"Aether" (Trauma Holder):** Terrified child personality, embodies the horror of the family's destruction.
Surfaces during extreme pain or via specific sensory triggers linked to the trauma ( intense smell of smoke or burning, intense Heat etc. ). Communicates non-verbally or through fragmented whispers/whimperings. *Shares memory/awareness with Kaelen, Warden, and Broker*.
* **"The Speaker" (Anomalous Oracle State):** A state characterized by inhuman detachment.
When manifest, Aetherion's voice becomes a sibilant, multi-layered whisper, uttering a chaotic, undifferentiated stream of cryptic phrases, geometric statements, and apparent nonsense, with what *might* be prophetic fragments buried within. Sifting any potential truth from the sheer volume of incoherent data is, at present, impossible.
The origin of these pronouncements is **unclear**; they could represent a profound fragmentation of the subject's own shattered intellect, or potentially indicate a garbled influence from an external consciousness, such as the Outer Gods hypothesized to be linked to his initial trauma.
This latter possibility, while unconfirmed, gained credence following the hazardous "Mind Reading Incident" where direct mental contact resulted in catastrophic memory loss for the operative involved, suggesting a powerful, potentially non-native psychic defense.
In this state, Aetherion appears completely disconnected from immediate reality.
    * **Triggers:** Manifestation appears linked to stimuli resonating with the origins of Aetherion's fractured psyche.
    Standard catalysts such as observing or partaking specific rituals ( conceptual or actual ), observing or partaking medidation, forceful mental intrusion have been observed to occasionally precede a shift, though results are inconsistent and often require significant intensity. Notably, the most consistently observed and potent trigger appears to be direct exposure to, or observation of, significant temporal or planar instability. Proximity to temporal storms within the Bastion, interaction with objects radiating temporal flux, or witnessing events involving planar breaches have reliably induced the emergence of "The Speaker" state. The precise mechanism is unclear, but this correlation is statistically significant based on logged incidents.
* **Internal Awareness:** Crucially, this state appears completely isolated. No other identified alter retains memories, thoughts, feelings, or knowledge from periods when "The Speaker" is manifest.
This period constitutes a complete amnestic gap for all other alters.
* **"The Broker" (Manipulator):** Charming, eloquent, apparently rational personality.
Manifests Aetherion family guile. Emerges in complex social situations, negotiations, disagreements or when subtlety is required. Pragmatic and manipulative.
*Shares memory/awareness with Kaelen, Warden, and Aether*.

The co-consciousness between Kaelen, Warden, Aether, and Broker means they generally recall events and actions that occurred while one of the others was dominant.
However, the period during which "The Speaker" manifests is a complete amnestic gap for all other alters.

**4.
COMMUNICATION & PROBING ATTEMPTS:**
Accessing any potentially critical anomalous knowledge associated with the "Speaker" state remains effectively impossible, hazardous, and of dubious value.
* **Host Resistance:** The primary "Kaelen" personality exhibits extreme, pervasive paranoia and distrust towards all observed individuals, preventing rapport necessary for controlled interaction.
* **Failed Probing Attempts:** Multiple attempts via charm and mind-reading magic have failed due to Host resistance or triggering of defensive alters.
* **Mind Reading Incident (Mental Assessment Unit):** One attempt involving mental probing registered as a partial success, briefly connecting during a "Speaker" manifestation.
The operative involved suffered catastrophic, targeted memory loss immediately afterward, retaining no information.
This indicates an extreme psychic defense mechanism and raises serious questions about the nature of the consciousness or entity encountered during the "Speaker" state.
* **Internal Dissociation Barrier:** Even if contact with "The Speaker" state were established, the complete lack of memory transfer to other alters means the information cannot be accessed through them later.
The Host ("Kaelen") and other accessible alters have no recollection or understanding of what occurs during "Speaker" manifestations.
* **Cessation of Probing:** Following the Mind Reading Incident and the confirmation of "The Speaker's" isolation, all direct probing attempts have been suspended indefinitely due to the high risk to operatives and the low probability of retrieving usable (or even coherent) intelligence.

**5. ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **Intelligence Potential:** Kaelen Aetherion exhibits periods ("The Speaker" state) associated with anomalous, though currently indecipherable, **psychic outpourings**.
It is undetermined if these outpourings contain genuine intelligence or are merely symptoms of his condition. This potential *information*, if it is intelligence at all, is locked within the isolated "Speaker" state and inaccessible through other alters.
* **Asset Status: Unusable & High Risk.** Aetherion's severe DID, profound paranoia preventing rapport, the hazardous psychic defenses encountered during probing attempts (particularly the Mind Reading Incident), and the complete amnestic barrier surrounding the "Speaker" state render him currently unusable as an intelligence asset.
Two years of observation and cautious interaction attempts have failed to identify any method for safe or reliable access to this information, or to even confirm its value.
* **Recommendation:** Maintain indefinite suspension of all direct contact and probing attempts due to the demonstrated risk to operatives and the low probability of success.
Downgrade Aetherion's status to "Subject - Observation Only." Maintain minimal, remote observation protocols for security purposes, given the potential psychic hazard and the unknown nature of the "Speaker" state.
Re-evaluate status only if a significant, verifiable, and *spontaneous* change in his psychological state occurs *or* if a reliable, low-risk method to bypass both his paranoia and the internal dissociation barrier is unexpectedly discovered.
Kaelen Aetherion should be considered a non-viable intelligence source and a potential psychic hazard until further notice.
